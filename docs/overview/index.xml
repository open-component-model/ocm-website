technology-agnostic way. It’s built to support secure, reliable delivery and deployment of software—across cloud, on-prem, hybrid, and even air-gapped environments.
By decoupling and streamlining lifecycle processes like compliance checks, security scans, and deployments, OCM helps teams collaborate more effectively
and build trust into every step of the software supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Benefits of OCM</title><link>https://ocm.software/docs/overview/benefits-of-ocm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ocm.software/docs/overview/benefits-of-ocm/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Software development is complex.
