[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website)
[![publish site status](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website/actions/workflows/publish-site.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website/actions/workflows/publish-site.yaml)

This repository houses the assets used to build [Open Component Model website](https://ocm.software).

The sources for some of the documentation are housed in other repositories with the Open Component Model GitHub Organisation. Documentation issues and pull requests should be made against those repositories:

| Project           | GitHub Source                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| OCM CLI           | <https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm>      |
| OCM Specification | <https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec> |

## How to modify this website

Content lives under the `content` directory.

New pages can be created using the following command:

```bash
npm run create <location>
```

This will create a page in draft mode. To make the page visible (and let it appear in the side bar) change `draft` to `false` in the header section of the page:

```text
---
title: ...
draft: false
```

For content generated from external sources (currently only valid for the OCM CLI), a GitHub Action will checkout the latest version of the remote repository, generate the documentation and create a PR against `main`. This can be be triggered as necessary using a manual dispatch:

```bash
gh workflow run
```

Alternatively, you can trigger the workflow via the menu "Actions -> Update OCM CLI Docs".

## Running the site locally

The following tools should be installed prior to running the site locally:

- [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

With the tooling in place you can install the node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the site:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:1313` to see the site running in your browser. Any updates you make to the site will be reflected in the browser immediately.

## Publishing the site

The Open Component Model website is published using GitHub Pages. A GitHub Actions workflow will run whenever there is a commit to the `main` branch. The workflow publishes the compiled assets to the `gh-pages` branch from which GitHub Pages will serve.

## Contributing

Code contributions, feature requests, bug reports, and help requests are very welcome.

OCM follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

### Guideline for AI-generated code contributions to SAP Open Source Software Projects

As artificial intelligence evolves, AI-generated code is becoming valuable for many software projects, including open-source initiatives. While we recognize the potential benefits of incorporating AI-generated content into our open-source projects there a certain requirements that need to be reflected and adhered to when making contributions.

When using AI-generated code contributions in OSS Projects, their usage needs to align with Open-Source Software values and legal requirements. We have established these essential guidelines to help contributors navigate the complexities of using AI tools while maintaining compliance with open-source licenses and the broader Open-Source Definition.
