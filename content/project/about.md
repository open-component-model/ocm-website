The Open Component Model provides a standard for describing delivery artifacts that can be accessed from many types of component repositories.

The following projects form this set of solutions (and more are in the works):

- [OCM Specifications](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/README.md) - The `ocm-spec` repository contains semantic, formatting, and other types of specifications for OCM.
- [OCM Library](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm#ocm-library) - The OCM Go library contains an API for interacting with the Open Component Model (OCM) elements and mechanisms. A usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/tree/main/examples/lib).
- [OCM CLI](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm#ocm-cli) - The `ocm` CLI may also be used to interact with OCM mechanisms. It makes it easy to create component versions and embed them in build processes. Examples can be found in [this Makefile](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/examples/make/Makefile).

Here are some suggested starting points:

- Read about the [problem statement](https://ocm.software/docs/overview/context) that the OCM set of solutions can help to solve.
- Start with the documentation about Model Elements [here](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/01-model/README.md).
- Check out this [demo](https://github.com/open-component-model/demo) that integrates with [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) as a CD solution.
