Master OCM through practical, task-oriented guides that solve real problems.
These how-to guides help you accomplish specific goals when working with OCM in production environments.

## What Are How-to Guides?

How-to guides are **task-oriented** recipes that show you how to solve specific problems.
Unlike tutorials, which are learning experiences, how-to guides assume you understand the basics and need to accomplish a concrete task.

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

- Clear objective and prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected results and verification
- Troubleshooting (when needed)

## Prerequisites

Before using these guides, you should have:

- Completed the [Getting Started]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}) guides or equivalent OCM experience
- Basic understanding of OCM concepts (components, resources, versions)
- The OCM CLI installed and configured
- Access to necessary tools and infrastructure for your specific task

## Learning Path

These guides follow the **task-oriented** approach from the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).
They focus on achieving specific goals rather than teaching concepts.
If you're new to OCM, complete the [Getting Started]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}) guides first.

For deeper understanding of OCM's architecture and design, explore the [Concepts]({{< relref "docs/concepts/_index.md" >}}) section.
To build comprehensive knowledge through hands-on exploration, check out the [Tutorials]({{< relref "docs/tutorials/_index.md" >}}) section.
