title: Configure Custom RBAC for Deployers
description: "How to grant the OCM K8s Toolkit controller additional RBAC permissions required by your deployer targets (e.g. kro ResourceGraphDefinitions)."

The OCM K8s Toolkit controller, ships with the minimum RBAC permissions needed to manage its own custom resources
(`Repository`, `Component`, `Resource`, `Deployer`). It does **not** include permissions for third-party resources
that your deployers may create or manage.

If your `Deployer` resources produce custom resources (e.g. kro `ResourceGraphDefinitions`), you must grant the
controller's service account the necessary permissions yourself.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you are already familiar with the concepts described in the following documents:

- [Concept: OCM controllers]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/ocm-controllers.md" >}}) - OCM Controllers
- [Installed Kro](https://kro.run/docs/getting-started/Installation/)

## When is this needed?

The controller uses [server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/) to create
and manage the resources defined in your `Deployer` specs. If a `Deployer` targets a custom resource type, the
controller needs RBAC permissions for that resource's API group.

This applies to both custom resources and standard Kubernetes resources. Common examples:

- **kro** `ResourceGraphDefinitions` (`kro.run`)
- `Deployments` (`apps`) and `Services` (`core`)
- Any other resource type your deployers create

## Create a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding

Create a `ClusterRole` with the permissions your deployers require, then bind it to the controller's service account.

Below is an example granting permissions for kro `ResourceGraphDefinitions` and the Kubernetes resources that the deployer manages:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: ocm-controller-custom
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - kro.run
    resources:
      - resourcegraphdefinitions
    verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
  - apiGroups:
      - apps
    resources:
      - deployments
    verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
  - apiGroups:
      - ""
    resources:
      - services
    verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: ocm-controller-custom
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: ocm-controller-custom
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: ocm-k8s-toolkit-controller-manager
    namespace: ocm-k8s-toolkit-system
```

Apply it to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f custom-rbac.yaml
```

{{<callout context="caution" title="Least Privilege" icon="outline/alert-triangle">}}
Follow the principle of least privilege. Only grant the verbs and resources your deployers actually need.
{{</callout>}}

## Verifying permissions

After applying, confirm that the controller has the expected access:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create resourcegraphdefinitions.kro.run \
  --as=system:serviceaccount:ocm-k8s-toolkit-system:ocm-k8s-toolkit-controller-manager
```

The output should be `yes`.

## Multiple deployer targets

If your deployers target several custom resource types, add additional rules to the same `ClusterRole`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: ocm-controller-custom
rules:
  - apiGroups:
      - kro.run
    resources:
      - resourcegraphdefinitions
    verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
  - apiGroups:
      - your.custom.group
    resources:
      - yourresources
    verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
```
