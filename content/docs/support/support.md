We are here to help you with any questions you have about OCM. Here are a few ways to get support:

1. Make sure you’ve read the basic documentation:
   - [OCM Overview](/docs/overview/about)
   - [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/installing-the-ocm-cli)
2. Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/glossary.md) of the OCM specification for definitions of terms.
3. Ask a question in the [OCM Slack Channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05UWBE8R1D) in the Kubernetes Workspace.
4. Check and read existing issues in the [OCM repositories](https://github.com/open-component-model), report a bug, or request a new feature.

<!-- 1. Look for an answer in the [FAQ](/docs/support/faq). // Commented because the FAQ is empty-->
