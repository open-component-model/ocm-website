We are here to help you with any questions you have about OCM. Here are a few ways to get support:

1. Make sure youâ€™ve read the basic documentation:
   - [OCM Overview](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website/blob/main/content/docs/overview/project.md)
   - [Getting Started](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website/blob/main/content/docs/getting-started/installation.md)
2. Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/glossary.md) of the OCM specification for definitions of terms.  
3. Look for an answer in the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website/blob/main/content/docs/support/faq.md).
4. Ask a question in the [OCM Slack Channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05UWBE8R1D) in the Kubernetes Workspace.
5. Check and read existing issues in the [OCM repositories](https://github.com/open-component-model), report a bug, or request a new feature.
