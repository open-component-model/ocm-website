Expand your OCM knowledge through comprehensive tutorials that explore advanced topics and real-world scenarios.
These tutorials guide you through complex workflows, helping you understand how different OCM features work together.

## What Are Tutorials?

Tutorials are **understanding-oriented** lessons that build comprehensive knowledge through hands-on exploration.
Unlike getting-started guides that focus on basic workflows, these tutorials dive deeper into specific topics,
showing you how to work with OCM in more complex scenarios.

Each tutorial provides:

- Detailed explanations of concepts and their relationships
- Step-by-step guidance through complete workflows
- Real-world examples and use cases
- Best practices and patterns

## Prerequisites

Before exploring these tutorials, you should have:

- Completed the [Getting Started]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}) guides to understand OCM fundamentals
- Basic familiarity with Kubernetes and container workflows
- A test environment where you can experiment safely

## Learning Path

These tutorials follow the **understanding-oriented** approach from the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).
They help you gain deeper knowledge by exploring topics in detail, beyond basic usage.
If you're just starting out, complete the [Getting Started]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}) guides first to learn essential OCM workflows.

For task-specific guidance, check the [How-to Guides]({{< relref "docs/how-to/_index.md" >}}) section.
To understand OCM's architectural principles, visit the [Concepts]({{< relref "docs/concepts/_index.md" >}}) section.
