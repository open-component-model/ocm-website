Just GitOps. With OCM as underlying model, the OCM Controllers as the execution engine, and their seamless integration into FluxCD you can manage your GitOps workflows with OCM.  

This integration allows you to leverage the power of OCM's component model and GitOps principles to automate the deployment and management of your applications and infrastructure.
