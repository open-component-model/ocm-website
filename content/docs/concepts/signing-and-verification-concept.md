OCM uses cryptographic signatures to guarantee that component versions are authentic (created by a trusted party) and have not been tampered with during storage or transfer.

## Why Sign Components?

The software lifecycle involves  multiple stages: development, build, packaging, distribution, and deployment. At each stage, components could potentially be:

- **Modified** — malicious actors could inject code or alter resources
- **Replaced** — components could be swapped for compromised versions
- **Misattributed** — components could falsely claim to come from a trusted source

Signing addresses these risks by creating a cryptographic proof of:

1. **Integrity**: The component has not changed since it was signed
2. **Authenticity**: The signature was created by someone with access to the private key
3. **Provenance**: The signer cannot deny having signed the component

        H --> I{Valid?}
        I -->|Yes| VALID["✓ Trusted"]
        I -->|No| INVALID["✗ Rejected"]
    end
```

### Normalization and Digest Calculation

OCM uses a two-layer approach to ensure consistent and reproducible digests:

#### Component Descriptor Normalization

Before hashing, the component descriptor is normalized into a canonical form, eliminating any ambiguities
that could cause the same logical descriptor to produce different digests. The default normalization
algorithm ([`jsonNormalisation/v4alpha1`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/04-extensions/04-algorithms/component-descriptor-normalization-algorithms.md#normalization-algorithms)) defines exactly how this canonical form is derived, ensuring
identical component descriptors always yield the same digest.

This entire approach relies on the fact that **content digests** are preserved across transfers.
Each resource's digest is computed from its actual content (not from where it is stored),
and this digest is recorded in the component descriptor. When a component version is transported to a different registry,
the `access` references change, but the content — and therefore its digest — remains the same.
This is why the signature remains valid after transfer.

#### Artifact Digest Normalization

OCM supports different digest algorithms for different artifact types.
The algorithm determines how a resource's content is hashed to produce its digest:

| Algorithm | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `genericBlobDigest/v1` | Direct hash of blob content. For OCI artifacts (container images, Helm charts), this is the hash of the top-level OCI manifest, ensuring consistency with OCI registry behavior. For non-OCI content (executables, blueprints), it is the direct hash of the raw blob. |
| `ociArtifactDigest/v1` | Computes the digest of the OCI manifest specifically. Effectively equivalent to `genericBlobDigest/v1` for OCI content. You may encounter this algorithm in older component descriptors. |

While the architecture allows for multiple digest algorithms, in practice **`genericBlobDigest/v1` is the only algorithm currently used** across all artifact types.

#### Recursive Component References

When a component version is **signed**, the digests of referenced components are calculated and embedded into the component descriptor.
This does **not** happen automatically when references are created — without signing, references can exist without digests,
and in that case there is no integrity guarantee for the referenced components.

```yaml
references:
  - componentName: ocm.software/helper
    name: helper
    version: 1.0.0
    digest:
      hashAlgorithm: SHA-256
      normalisationAlgorithm: jsonNormalisation/v4alpha1
      value: 01c211f5c9cfd7c40e5b84d66a2fb7d19cb0...
```

Once signed, this creates a **complete integrity chain** — verifying the root component automatically verifies all transitive dependencies.

### What Gets Signed?

OCM signs a **digest** of the normalized component descriptor (see [Normalization and Digest Calculation](#normalization-and-digest-calculation)
for how the canonical form is derived). The signed digest covers:

- Component metadata (name, version, provider)
- Resource descriptors (including digest, if available)
- Source descriptors (including digest, if available)
- Component references (including digest, if available)
- Labels marked with `signing: true` (at any level)

Labels without `signing: true` are excluded from the digest and do not affect the signature.
Storage-related fields like `access` and `repositoryContexts` are also excluded — see [Normalization and Digest Calculation](#normalization-and-digest-calculation) above.

The signature does **not** cover the raw resource content directly — instead, it covers the **digests** of those resources as recorded in the component descriptor. The `access` field (which describes *where* a resource is stored) is **excluded** from the signed digest. This is a key design principle:

- **Location-independent integrity** — a component version can be transferred to a different registry (changing all `access` references) without invalidating its signature. The digest remains stable because it depends only on *what* the artifacts contain, not *where* they are stored.
- Any change to resource content changes its digest, invalidating the signature.
- Signature verification is fast (no need to re-hash large binaries).

This separation of content identity from storage location is what enables secure delivery across environments: a producer signs a component version once, and consumers can verify it after any number of transfers — even into air-gapped environments with completely different registries.

The following example shows a signed component descriptor. Notice that each resource has both an `access` field (storage location) and a `digest` field (content hash). Only the `digest` is included in the signature — the `access` can change freely during transfers:

```
{{< /details >}}

### Signature Storage

Signatures are stored as part of the component version:

```yaml
signatures:
  - name: acme-release-signing
    digest:
      hashAlgorithm: SHA-256
      normalisationAlgorithm: jsonNormalisation/v4alpha1
      value: abc123...
    signature:
      algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
      mediaType: application/vnd.ocm.signature.rsa
      value: <base64-encoded-signature>
```

A component version can have **multiple signatures** from different parties, enabling:

- Separation of build and release signing
- Multiple approval workflows
- Cross-organizational trust chains

## Supported Signing Algorithms

OCM currently only supports RSA-based signing algorithms:

| Algorithm | Type | Characteristics |
| --------- | ---- | --------------- |
| RSASSA-PSS (default) | Asymmetric | Probabilistic, stronger security guarantees, recommended for new implementations |
| RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 | Asymmetric | Deterministic, widely supported, compatible with legacy systems |

To override the default signing algorithm or encoding policy, see the `--signer-spec` flag in the [CLI reference]({{< relref "/docs/reference/ocm-cli/ocm_sign_component-version.md" >}}).
The signer spec file configures only the algorithm and encoding policy — credentials are always resolved separately via the [`.ocmconfig`]({{< relref "configure-multiple-credentials.md" >}}) file.

For key management, OCM uses PEM-encoded key files configured in the `.ocmconfig`:

- **Private keys**: Used by producers to sign component versions
- **Public keys**: Distributed to consumers for verification

See [How-to: Generate Signing Keys]({{< relref "docs/how-to/generate-signing-keys.md" >}}) for creating RSA key pairs.

{{< callout context="tip" title="Upcoming Sigstore Support" icon="outline/bulb" >}}
We are planning to add support for [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) and Cosign as an additional signing mechanism.
This will enable keyless signing workflows and improved supply chain security. Stay tuned for updates.

### Signature Encoding Policies

The `signatureEncodingPolicy` in the [signer spec]({{< relref "/docs/reference/ocm-cli/ocm_sign_component-version.md" >}}) controls how the **signature output** is serialized and stored. It does **not** affect the format of key input files, which are always PEM-encoded.

| Policy | Signature Format | Media Type | Certificate Chain | Verification Requires |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **Plain** (default) | Hex-encoded raw bytes | `application/vnd.ocm.signature.rsa.pss` | Not embedded | Externally supplied public key |
| **PEM** (early access) | PEM `SIGNATURE` block + `CERTIFICATE` blocks | `application/x-pem-file` | Embedded in signature | Valid certificate chain in signature |

#### Plain Encoding (Default)

The raw RSA signature bytes are hex-encoded and stored directly. This is the most compact representation.
Verification always requires the public key to be provided separately via `.ocmconfig` credentials.

Example signature in a component descriptor:

```yaml
signature:
  algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
  mediaType: application/vnd.ocm.signature.rsa.pss
  value: d1ea6e0cd850c8dbd0d20cd39b9c7954...
```

#### PEM Encoding (Experimental)

The signature is wrapped in a PEM block of type `SIGNATURE`, optionally followed by the signer's X.509 certificate chain.
This makes the signature **self-contained**: verifiers can extract and validate the public key from the embedded chain
without needing a separately distributed key.

Example of a PEM-encoded signature value:

```yaml
signature:
      algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
      mediaType: application/x-pem-file
      value: |
        -----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----
        Signature Algorithm: RSASSA-PSS
        
        <base64-encoded signature bytes>
        -----END SIGNATURE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <leaf certificate>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <intermediate CA, if applicable>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

{{< callout context="note" title="PEM encoding is in early access" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
PEM encoding is currently being rolled out across projects and we are awaiting feedback. The interface may evolve based on that feedback.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout context="note" title="Key files vs. signature encoding" icon="outline/info-circle" >}}
A common source of confusion: "PEM" in `signatureEncodingPolicy` refers to the **signature output** format, not the key input format. Input keys are **always** PEM-encoded files (e.g. `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`), regardless of which encoding policy is selected.

When using PEM encoding for signing, the credential referenced by `public_key_pem` / `public_key_pem_file` must contain **X.509 certificates** (not bare public keys), because the certificate chain is embedded into the signature for self-contained verification.

## Trust Models

The encoding policy you choose determines how verifiers establish trust in a signature.

### Key Pinning (Plain Encoding)

The verifier explicitly configures the signer's public key in `.ocmconfig`. Trust is established by knowing the exact key that was used to sign.

- No PKI infrastructure required
- Simple to set up for small teams or self-signed workflows
- Verifier must obtain the public key out-of-band (e.g., from a secrets manager or shared repository)
- Rotating keys requires updating every verifier's configuration

### Certificate Chain Trust (PEM Encoding)

The signer embeds the certificate chain (leaf + any intermediates) directly in the signature value. The verifier pins only the root CA certificate as a trust anchor.

- Requires PKI infrastructure (or a locally generated CA)
- Verifier only needs the root CA — leaf certificates can change without reconfiguring verifiers
- Supports organizational delegation: the root CA can issue intermediate CAs for different teams
- The root CA is never embedded in the signature; OCM rejects self-signed certificates found in the embedded chain

### When to Use Each

| Criterion | Plain (Key Pinning) | PEM (Certificate Chain) |
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| PKI infrastructure available | No | Yes |
| Number of signers | Few | Many or changing |
| Key rotation complexity | High (update all verifiers) | Low (root CA stays stable) |
| Signature is self-contained | No (public key needed separately) | Yes |
| Recommended for | Simple setups, personal projects | Enterprise environments |
