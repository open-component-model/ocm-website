## Setting Up Environment Variables (Optional)

For convenience, we will define the following environment variables:

```bash
PROVIDER="acme.org"
ORG="acme"
COMPONENT="github.com/${ORG}/helloworld"
VERSION="1.0.0"
CA_ARCHIVE="ca-hello-world"
OCM_REPO="ghcr.io/<github-org>/ocm"
```

If you specify values for your setup, you can directly use the commands shown in the next steps.
The variable `OCM_REPO` is set to a location of an OCI registry where artifacts and component
descriptors are stored (omitting the `https://` prefix). For example,
[GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) can be used as an OCI registry. Many other
options exist.

Let's assume that we are creating a component based on a GitHub source repository.

## Create a Component Archive

The first step when creating a new component version is to create a component archive. A component archive contains references, resources, and sources. The `ocm` CLI tool can help with this.

We begin by creating an empty component archive using the command [`ocm create componentarchive`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_create_componentarchive.md):

```shell
ocm create componentarchive ${COMPONENT} ${VERSION}  --provider ${PROVIDER} --file $CA_ARCHIVE
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

This command creates the following file structure:

```bash
$ tree ca-hello-world
ca-hello-world
├── blobs
└── component-descriptor.yaml
```

The [component descriptor](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/01-model/01-model.md#components-and-component-versions)
is stored as a yaml file named `component-descriptor.yaml`. It describes the content of a component version.

It contains the following configuration:

```yaml
meta:
  schemaVersion: v2
component:
  name: github.com/acme/helloworld
  version: 1.0.0
  provider: acme.org
  resources: []
  sources: []
  componentReferences: []
```

By default, the command creates a directory structure. The option `--type` can be used to select other target formats, such as `tar` or `tgz`.

</details>

## Add a Local Resource

The next step is [`ocm add resources`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_add_resources.md). First, we want to add a Helm Chart stored in a local folder named `helmchart`.

```shell
ocm add resource $CA_ARCHIVE --type helmChart --name mychart --version ${VERSION} --inputType helm --inputPath ./helmchart
```

```shell
processing resource (by options)...
  processing document 1...
    processing index 1
found 1 resources
adding resource helmChart: "name"="mychart","version"="1.0.0"...
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

The generated file structure is:

```shell
tree ca-hello-world
```

```shell
ca-hello-world
├── blobs
│   └── sha256.60bfd05083f81f2841657e24410d3ba25e4bcc3e3c927da7e1811e775116a74d
└── component-descriptor.yaml
```

The added blob contains the packaged Helm Chart. The blob is referenced in the component descriptor
in `component.resources.access.localreference`:

```yaml
meta:
  schemaVersion: v2
component:
  name: github.com/acme/helloworld
  version: 1.0.0
  provider: acme.org
  resources:
  - access:
      localReference: sha256.60bfd05083f81f2841657e24410d3ba25e4bcc3e3c927da7e1811e775116a74d
      mediaType: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+tar+gzip
      referenceName: github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserver:0.1.0
      type: localBlob
    name: mychart
    relation: local
    type: helmChart
    version: 1.0.0
  sources: []
  componentReferences: []
```

Because we use content from the local environment, it is directly packaged into the component archive
using the [access method](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/04-extensions/02-access-types/README.md) of type
[`localBlob`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/04-extensions/02-access-types/localblob.md).
</details>

## Add an Image

Next, we will add an image. This can be done in one of two ways:

### Add an Image Reference (Option 1)

If the image is already stored in an image registry (e.g., by a previous Docker build/push), you can simply add a reference to it.

```shell
ocm add resource $CA_ARCHIVE --type ociImage --name image --version ${VERSION} --accessType ociArtifact --reference gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.10
```

```shell
processing resource (by options)...
  processing document 1...
    processing index 1
found 1 resources
adding resource ociImage: "name"="image","version"="1.0.0"...
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

The component descriptor now has the following content, with an additional `access` under
`component.resources`, where `access` is of type `external`:

```yaml
meta:
  schemaVersion: v2
component:
  name: github.com/acme/helloworld
  version: 1.0.0
  provider: acme.org
  resources:
  - access:
      localReference: sha256.60bfd05083f81f2841657e24410d3ba25e4bcc3e3c927da7e1811e775116a74d
      mediaType: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+tar+gzip
      referenceName: github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserver:0.1.0
      type: localBlob
    name: mychart
    relation: local
    type: helmChart
    version: 1.0.0
  - access:
      imageReference: gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.10
      type: ociArtifact
    name: image
    relation: external
    type: ociImage
    version: 1.0.0
  sources: []
  componentReferences: []
  repositoryContexts: []
```

</details>

### Add an Image Resource (Option 2)

Alternatively, you can add an image as a resource built locally using Docker before. It will be picked up from the local Docker file system and added to the component archive.

```shell
docker image ls

REPOSITORY                                              TAG                 IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
echoserverimage                                         1.10.0              365ec60129c5   4 years ago     95.4MB
...
```

```shell
ocm add resource ${CA_ARCHIVE} --name image --version ${VERSION} --type ociArtifact  --inputType docker --inputPath=echoserverimage:1.10.0
```

```shell
processing resource (by options)...
  processing document 1...
    processing index 1
found 1 resources
adding resource ociArtifact: "name"="image","version"="1.0.0"...
  image echoserverimage:1.10.0
locator: echoserverimage, repo: , version 1.10.0
~/temp/ocm/hello>
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

The Docker image is downloaded from the Docker daemon, converted to an OCI artifact,
and added as local artifact to the component version.
The component descriptor now has the content:

```yaml
component:
  componentReferences: []
  name: github.com/acme/helloworld
  provider: acme.org
  repositoryContexts: []
  resources:
  - access:
      localReference: sha256.31b7c98008a6b2d6f0b07e11b997c47c70d31edeea0986382940ccc42288741e
      mediaType: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+tar+gzip
      referenceName: github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserverimage:1.10.0
      type: localBlob
    name: image
    relation: local
    type: ociArtifact
    version: 1.0.0
  - access:
      localReference: sha256.cf0b6e95c1f05e6825d37e15744f46c6fdb37eea7be2234b8948be71b28ff6b1
      mediaType: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+tar+gzip
      referenceName: github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserver:0.1.0
      type: localBlob
    name: mychart
    relation: local
    type: helmChart
    version: 1.0.0
  sources: []
  version: 1.0.0
meta:
  schemaVersion: v2
```

The generated blob `sha256.65cf...` is an archive describing the image according to the
[OCI Image Layout Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.0.1/image-layout.md).

</details>

## Using a Resources File (Optional)

You could simplify the previous two steps (adding helm chart and image as resources) by using a text file as input. For that, you could create a file `resources.yaml`, which looks like this:

```yaml
---
name: mychart
type: helmChart
input:
  type: helm
  path: ./helmchart
---
name: image
type: ociImage
version: "1.0.0"
access:
  type: ociArtifact
  imageReference: gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.10
```

A resource is described either by its access information to a remote repository or by locally
provided resources. For remote access, the field `access` is used to describe the
[access method](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/doc/04-extensions/02-access-types/README.md). The type field is used to specify the kind of access.

If the resource content should be taken from local resources, the field `input` is used to specify
the access to local resources. In this case, the resource content is directly put into the component
archive. Similarly to the `access` attribute, the kind of the input source is described by the field `type`.
The input types are not part of the input specification but are provided locally by the OCM command
line client. For available input types, see [`ocm add resources`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_add_resources.md).

For more complex scenarios, the description files might use variable substitution (templating), see [Best Practices](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-website/blob/main/content/docs/tutorials/best-practices-with-ocm.md#templating-the-resources).

Add the resources using the following command:

```shell
ocm add resources $CA_ARCHIVE resources.yaml
```

```shell
processing resources.yaml...
  processing document 1...
    processing index 1
  processing document 2...
    processing index 1
found 2 resources
adding resource helmChart: "name"="mychart","version"="<componentversion>"...
adding resource ociImage: "name"="image","version"="1.0.0"...
```

For a local image built with Docker use this file:

```shell
---
name: mychart
type: helmChart
input:
  type: helm
  path: ./helmchart
---
name: image
type: ociImage
version: "1.0.0"
input:
  type: docker
  repository: echoserverimage
  path: echoserverimage:1.10.0
```

## Upload the Component Versions

To upload the component version to an OCI registry, you can transfer the component archive using the command [`ocm transfer componentarchive`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_transfer_componentarchive.md):

```shell
OCMREPO=ghcr.io/acme
ocm transfer componentarchive ./ca-hello-world ${OCMREPO}
```

```shell
transferring version "github.com/acme/helloworld:1.0.0"...
...resource 0(github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserver:0.1.0)...
...adding component version...
```

## Bundle Composed Components

If you have created multiple components according to the instructions above, you can bundle
them into a single archive entity. This can be done by creating a transport archive.

The transport archive is the entity that does the transfer between
component repositories. It is used to transfer entire deployments between
locations.

A transport archive may contain any number of component versions. It may also be pushed to an OCM repository.

Note that a transport archive is also an OCM repository, so it can also be used as source or as a target
for transport operations.

```shell
CTF_ARCHIVE=ctf-hello-world
ocm transfer componentversion ${CA_ARCHIVE} ${CTF_ARCHIVE}
```

```shell
transferring version "github.com/acme/helloworld:1.0.0"...
...resource 0(github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserver:0.1.0)...
...adding component version...
1 versions transferred
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

The resulting transport archive has the following file structure:

```shell
tree ${CTF_ARCHIVE}
```

```shell
ctf-hello-world
├── artifact-index.json
└── blobs
    ├── sha256.378a171e7a1bcecc19b7fd4a330161a9d91550486dad668c78d08e590ef245e7
    ├── sha256.4f2080d8d41d2b52182f325f4f42d91e2581e3f2299f4f8631196801773ba869
    ├── sha256.63dc40246a604ef503f0361e14216ab7e002912697d09da49f50bba7091549f7

```

The transport archive's contents can be found in `artifact-index.json`. This file
contains the list of component version artifacts to be transported.

```shell
jq . ${CTF_ARCHIVE}/artifact-index.json
```

```shell
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "repository": "component-descriptors/github.com/acme/helloworld",
      "tag": "1.0.0",
      "digest": "sha256:63dc40246a604ef503f0361e14216ab7e002912697d09da49f50bba7091549f7"
    }
  ]
}
```

The content of the transport archive is stored as OCI artifacts. Notice that the repository names of Component Version artifacts (found at `artifacts.respository`) are prefixed by `component-descriptors/`.

The component version is described as an OCI manifest:

```shell
jq . ${CTF_ARCHIVE}/blobs/sha256.63dc40246a604ef503f0361e14216ab7e002912697d09da49f50bba7091549f7
```

```shell
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.ocm.software.component.config.v1+json",
    "digest": "sha256:b9bf66cb07b129d12956392dff6110874c37a1b06ed8dde88881f6de971ff293",
    "size": 201
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.ocm.software.component-descriptor.v2+yaml+tar",
      "digest": "sha256:4f2080d8d41d2b52182f325f4f42d91e2581e3f2299f4f8631196801773ba869",
      "size": 2560
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+tar+gzip",
      "digest": "sha256:378a171e7a1bcecc19b7fd4a330161a9d91550486dad668c78d08e590ef245e7",
      "size": 4747
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that the output of the component version above contains the component descriptor as one of the `layers`. It can be identified by its content type, which is `application/vnd.ocm.software.component-descriptor.v2+yaml+tar`. In this case, the component descriptor can be displayed with the following command:

```shell
tar xvf ctf-hello-world/blobs/sha256.4f2080d8d41d2b52182f325f4f42d91e2581e3f2299f4f8631196801773ba869 -O - component-descriptor.yaml
```

```shell

      localReference: sha256:378a171e7a1bcecc19b7fd4a330161a9d91550486dad668c78d08e590ef245e7
      mediaType: application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+tar+gzip
      referenceName: github.com/acme/helloworld/echoserver:0.1.0
      type: localBlob
    name: mychart
    relation: local
    type: helmChart
    version: 1.0.0

    relation: external
    type: ociImage
    version: 1.0.0
  sources: []
  version: 1.0.0
meta:
  schemaVersion: v2
```

The other elements listed as `layers` describe the blobs for the local resources stored along with the component version. The digests can be seen in the `localReference` attributes of the component descriptor.

</details>

## All in One

The previous steps can be combined into a single operation working on a single description file:

- Creating a Common Transport Archive
- Adding one or more components
- With resources, sources, and references

The command [`ocm add componentversions`](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm/blob/main/docs/reference/ocm_add_componentversions.md)
directly creates or extends a common transport archive without the need for creating dedicated component archives.

Create a yaml configuration file `component-constructor.yaml`, which contains information about the components
to create and the elements added to those components:

```yaml
components:
- name: github.com/acme.org/helloworld
  version: "1.0.0"
  provider:
    name: acme.org
  resources:
    - name: mychart
      type: helmChart
      input:
        type: helm
        path: ./helmchart
    - name: image
      type: ociImage
      version: "1.0.0"
      access:
        type: ociArtifact
        imageReference: gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.10
```

```shell
ocm add componentversions --create --file ${CTF_ARCHIVE} component-constructor.yaml
```

```shell
processing component-constructor.yaml...
  processing document 1...
    processing index 1
found 1 component
adding component github.com/acme.org/helloworld:1.0.0...
  adding resource helmChart: "name"="mychart","version"="<componentversion>"...
  adding resource ociImage: "name"="image","version"="1.0.0"...
```

<details><summary>What happened?</summary>

The command creates the common-transport-archive (option `--create`) and adds the listed components
with the described resources.

```shell
tree ${CTF_ARCHIVE}
```

```shell
