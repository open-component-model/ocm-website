Welcome to OCM! These tutorials guide you through essential OCM workflows, from creating your first component version to deploying applications with OCM controllers.

## What You'll Learn

The getting-started tutorials are designed to be completed in sequence. Each tutorial builds on the previous one, teaching you fundamental OCM concepts through practical examples:

1. **[Install the OCM CLI](ocm-cli-installation/)** - Set up the OCM command-line tool
2. **[Create Component Versions](create-component-version/)** - Bundle and store your software artifacts
3. **[Set Up a Controller Environment](setup-controller-environment/)** - Prepare a local Kubernetes cluster with OCM controllers
4. **[Deploy a Helm Chart](deploy-helm-chart/)** - Deploy applications from component versions using controllers

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- Internet access to download tools and container images

## Learning Path

These tutorials follow the **learning-oriented** approach from the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). Every step is designed to work exactly as written, producing visible, verifiable results. If you're new to OCM, start with the first tutorial and work through them in order.
