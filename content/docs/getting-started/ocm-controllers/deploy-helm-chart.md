This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Helm Chart from an OCM component version using OCM K8s Toolkit, kro, and FluxCD.
It is a rather basic example, in which it is assumed that a developer created an application, packaged it as a Helm
chart, and publishes it as OCM component version in an OCI registry. Then, an operator who wants to deploy the
application via Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster, creates a `ResourceGraphDefinition` with resources that point to
this OCM component version. Using CEL expressions inside the `ResourceGraphDefinition`, the information about the
resource location will be passed to FluxCD, which will then configure the Helm chart and deploy it into the Kubernetes
cluster.

Before starting, make sure you have set up your environment as described in the [setup guide](/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/set-up-your-environment).

## Create the OCM component version

First, we will create an OCM component version containing a Helm chart. For this example, we will use the `podinfo`
Helm chart, which is a simple web application that serves a pod information page. For more details on how to create an
OCM component version, please refer to the [OCM documentation][ocm-doc].

To create the OCM component version, we will use the following `component-constructor.yaml` file:

```yaml
components:
  - name: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple
    provider:
      name: ocm.software
    version: "1.0.0"
    resources:
      - name: helm-resource
        type: helmChart
        version: 1.0.0
        access:
          type: ociArtifact
          imageReference: "ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo:6.9.1@sha256:565d310746f1fa4be7f93ba7965bb393153a2d57a15cfe5befc909b790a73f8a"
```

After creating the file, we can create the OCM component version:

```bash
ocm add componentversion --create --file ./ctf component-constructor.yaml
```

This will create a local CTF (Component Transfer Format) directory `./ctf` containing the OCM component version. Since
the OCM component version must be accessible for the OCM K8s Toolkit controllers, we will transfer the CTF to a
registry. For this example, we will use GitHub's container registry, but you can use any OCI registry:

```bash
ocm transfer ctf ./ctf ghcr.io/<your-namespace>
```

{{<callout context="note">}}
If you are using a registry that requires authentication, you need to provide credentials for ocm. Please refer to
the [OCM CLI credentials documentation][ocm-credentials] for more information on how to set up and use credentials.
{{</callout>}}

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```bash
ocm get componentversion ghcr.io/<your-namespace>//ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple:1.0.0
```

```console
COMPONENT                           VERSION PROVIDER
ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple 1.0.0   ocm.software
```

## Deploy the Helm Chart

To deploy the Helm chart from the OCM component version, we will first create a `ResourceGraphDefinition` that contains
all required resources. Additionally, we will add a configuration to the `HelmRelease` resource that can be passed
through the instance of that `ResourceGraphDefinition`. After the `ResourceGraphDefinition` is created and applied, we
create the instance of the `ResourceGraphDefinition` that will deploy the Helm chart.

### Create and apply the `ResourceGraphDefinition`

The `ResourceGraphDefinition` is a custom resource that defines all the resources that should be applied. To proceed
with the example, create a file named `rgd.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceGraphDefinition
metadata:
  name: simple
spec:
  schema:
    apiVersion: v1alpha1
    # The name of the CRD that is created by this ResourceGraphDefinition when applied
    kind: Simple
    spec:
      # This spec defines values that can be referenced in the ResourceGraphDefinition and that can be set in the
      # instances of this ResourceGraphDefinition.
      # We will use it to pass a value to the Helm chart and configure the message the application shows
      # (see resource HelmRelease).
      message: string | default="foo"
  resources:
    # Repository points to the OCM repository in which the OCM component version is stored and checks if it is
    # reachable by pinging it.
    - id: repository
      template:
        apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1
        kind: Repository
        metadata:
          name: simple-repository
        spec:
          repositorySpec:
              baseUrl: ghcr.io/<your-namespace>
              type: OCIRegistry
          interval: 1m
          # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it.
          # ocmConfig:
    # Component refers to the Repository, downloads and verifies the OCM component version descriptor.
    - id: component
      template:
        apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1
        kind: Component
        metadata:
          name: simple-component
        spec:
          repositoryRef:
            name: ${repository.metadata.name}
          component: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple
          semver: 1.0.0
          interval: 1m
          # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it.
          # ocmConfig:
    # Resource points to the Component, downloads the resource passed by reference-name and verifies it. It then
    # publishes the location of the resource in its status.
    - id: resourceChart
      template:
        apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1
        kind: Resource
        metadata:
          name: simple-resource
        spec:
          componentRef:
            name: ${component.metadata.name}
          resource:
            byReference:
              resource:
                name: helm-resource # This must match the resource name set in the OCM component version (see above)
          interval: 1m
          # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it.
          # ocmConfig:
    # OCIRepository watches and downloads the resource from the location provided by the Resource status.
    # The Helm chart location (url) refers to the status of the above resource.
    - id: ocirepository
      template:
        apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
        kind: OCIRepository
        metadata:
          name: simple-ocirepository
        spec:
          interval: 1m0s
          layerSelector:

            operation: copy

          ref:
            tag: ${resourceChart.status.reference.tag}
          # secretRef is required, if the OCI repository requires credentials to access it.
          # secretRef:
    # HelmRelease refers to the OCIRepository, lets you configure the helm chart and deploys the Helm Chart into the
    # Kubernetes cluster.
    - id: helmrelease
      template:
        apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
        kind: HelmRelease
        metadata:
          name: simple-helmrelease
        spec:
          releaseName: simple
          interval: 1m
          timeout: 5m
          chartRef:
            kind: OCIRepository
            name: ${ocirepository.metadata.name}
            namespace: default
          values:
            # We configure the Helm chart using FluxCDs HelmRelease 'values' field. We pass the value that we set in
            # the instance of the CRD created by the ResourceGraphDefinition (see below).
            ui:
              message: ${schema.spec.message}
```

{{<callout context="note">}}
If you pushed the OCM component version to a private registry, you need to set up the credentials for the OCM K8s
Toolkit resources. You can do this by uncommenting the `ocmConfig` fields in the `Repository`, `Component`, and
`Resource` resources and providing the necessary credentials. For more information on how to set up and pass the
credentials, please check out the guide [configure credentials for OCM K8s Toolkit resources](credentials.md).

Be aware that FluxCD's `OCIRepository` also needs access to the OCI registry that contains the Helm chart. However,
`OCIRepository` only accepts
[`imagePullSecrets`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/#secret-reference) in the same namespace.
If you want to use the same credentials for FluxCD and for the OCM K8s Toolkit resources, create a
[Kubernetes secret of type `dockerconfigjson`](credentials.md#create-a-kubernetes-secret-of-type-dockerconfigjson-to-access-private-ocm-repositories)
and keep all the resources in the same namespace.
{{</callout>}}

After creating the file `rgd.yaml` with the above content and adjusting Repository's `baseUrl` to point to your OCM
repository, you can apply the `ResourceGraphDefinition` to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rgd.yaml
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```bash
kubectl get rgd
```

```console
NAME     APIVERSION   KIND     STATE    AGE
simple   v1alpha1     Simple   Active   19s
```

This creates a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) `Simple` that can be used to create instances. An applied
instance of the CRD will create all resources defined in the `ResourceGraphDefinition`.

### Create an Instance of "Simple"

To create an instance of the `Simple` CRD, create a file named `instance.yaml` and add the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1
# Kind is the CRD name that was created by the ResourceGraphDefinition
kind: Simple
metadata:
  name: simple
spec:
  # This field is passed to the Helm chart and configures the message that podinfo will show
  message: "bar"
```

Proceed by applying the instance which will create all the resources defined in the `ResourceGraphDefinition`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f instance.yaml
```

This will take some time, but if everything went well, you should see the following output:

```bash
kubectl get simple
```

```console
NAME     STATE    SYNCED   AGE
simple   ACTIVE   True     5m28s
```

and the deployment should be in the state `Available`:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
```

```console
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
simple-podinfo        1/1     1            1           40m
```

To make sure that the deployment was configured successfully, take a look at the pod itself or execute the following
command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=simple-podinfo -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].env[?(@.name=="PODINFO_UI_MESSAGE")].value}'
```

which should return the value you passed in the instance:

```console
bar
```

You now have successfully created an OCM component version containing a Helm chart and deployed as well as configured it
using the OCM K8s Toolkit, kro, and FluxCD.

#### Troubleshooting

One common issue, when using GitHub's container registry, is that the transferred OCM component is by default a
private package. If so, you might see an error like the following:

```console
failed to list versions: failed to list tags: GET "https://ghcr.io/v2...": response status code 401: unauthorized: authentication required
```

You can resolve this issue by making the package public or by [providing credentials](/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/configuring-credentials) to the
respective resources.
