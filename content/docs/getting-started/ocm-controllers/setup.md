This document describes how to set up a local environment for testing and running examples from the [`examples/`](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/tree/main/kubernetes/controller/examples) directory or the [getting-started guides]({{< ref "docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/_index.md" >}}).

## Prerequisites

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [ocm CLI](https://ocm.software/docs/getting-started/installation/) (will not be used in this guide, but is required to follow the examples and getting-started guides)

## Start a local Kubernetes cluster with kind

{{<callout context="note">}}
You don't need to run kind if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster you have access to. If so, you can skip this.
{{</callout>}}

For download and installation instructions, see the
[kind documentation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start).

To create a local kind cluster run the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

## Install kro

Please follow the official installation guides for [kro](https://kro.run/docs/getting-started/Installation). You might
need [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install kro.

If kro is installed correctly, you should see some similar output when running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

```console
NAMESPACE            NAME                                         READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
...
kro                  kro-86d5b5b5bd-6gmvr                         1/1     Running            0               3h28m
...
```

## Install a deployer

Currently, we created our examples and getting-started guides using [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) as deployer.
But, in theory, you could use any other deployer that is able to apply a deployable resource to a Kubernetes cluster,
for instance [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

To install FluxCD, please follow the official [installation guide](https://fluxcd.io/docs/installation/). After you
installed the cli tool, you can run the following command to install the FluxCD controllers:

```bash
flux install
```

If the FluxCD controllers are installed correctly, you should see some similar output when running the following
command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

```console
NAMESPACE            NAME                                         READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
...
flux-system          helm-controller-b6767d66-zbwws               1/1     Running            0               3h29m
flux-system          kustomize-controller-57c7ff5596-v6fvr        1/1     Running            0               3h29m

...
kro                  kro-86d5b5b5bd-6gmvr                         1/1     Running            0               3h28m
...
```

## Install the OCM K8s Toolkit

To install the OCM K8s, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
# In the ocm-k8s-toolkit/ repository
make deploy
```

or

```bash
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/kubernetes/controller/config/default?ref=main
```

If the OCM K8s Toolkit controllers are installed correctly, you should see some similar output when running the
following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

```console
NAMESPACE            NAME                                         READY   STATUS             RESTARTS        AGE
...
flux-system              helm-controller-b6767d66-zbwws                        1/1     Running            0               3h39m
flux-system              kustomize-controller-57c7ff5596-v6fvr                 1/1     Running            0               3h39m

...
kro                      kro-86d5b5b5bd-6gmvr                                  1/1     Running            0               3h38m

```

## Access to a registry

As all examples and guides will create an OCM component version that will be consumed by the OCM K8s Toolkit, you will
need access to a registry. You can either choose a public registry like [ghcr.io][ghcr.io] or deploy a registry (like
[`registry`][registry], [`zot`][zot], ...) into your Kubernetes cluster.

{{<callout context="caution">}}
If you choose to deploy a registry into your Kubernetes cluster, you have to make sure it is accessible from outside
the cluster (for `ocm transfer` to work) and inside the cluster (for the OCM K8s Toolkit controllers to work).

We **strongly** recommend to use a registry that is publicly accessible, like [ghcr.io][ghcr.io].
(Deploying your own registry requires a lot of additional configuration. Especially, if you want to try out the
localization example, you will need to configure a registry that is accessible with the same address from your
CLI, kubelet, and inside the cluster.)
{{</callout>}}

If you completed all of the above steps, you are ready to go. You can now play around with the examples in the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/tree/main/kubernetes/controller/examples) directory or follow the [Getting Started Guides]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/_index.md" >}}).
