The Open Component Model (OCM) is an open-source toolset for secure software delivery.

- OCM gives you full visibility and control across the supply chain, streamlining compliance checks, security scans, and deployments.
- OCM works everywhere — cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and air-gapped environments.
- OCM integrates seamlessly with your existing tools and is easy to extend.

With OCM, you gain control, reduce risk, and keep your delivery approach adaptable.

## Why choose OCM

#### One Model for All Artifacts

With OCM, you can describe everything you deliver in a unified, machine-readable format. This enables you to create a *Software Bill of Delivery (SBoD)*. Unlike a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which lists all components inside an application, a **Software Bill of Delivery** focuses on **everything you need for a successful deployment** — including container images, Helm charts, configuration files, and binaries. It is a complete, verifiable record of all deliverables and how to access them.

### Security & End-to-End Traceability

Security is built into OCM. You can **cryptographically sign and verify** every component in your supply chain to ensure its integrity or confirm its provenance.

Beyond signatures, OCM uses [**immutable, globally unique component identities**]({{<relref "coordinates.md">}}). These act like tracking IDs, linking all lifecycle phases. They make compliance checks, audits, and vulnerability scans easier and more reliable. With OCM, your software is fully traceable from build to deployment.


### Universal Delivery

You can **deliver across boundaries** and **deploy anywhere — public cloud, on-premises, or air-gapped environments**. OCM separates the identity of software artifacts from their location. Identities remain stable while locations can change as needed. You can store software artifacts in local registries, move them between systems, and work in environments with limited or no internet access — all without losing integrity or traceability.

### Technology-Neutral and Extensible

OCM **works with your current tools**. It is compatible with any implementation technology, whether container images, NPM packages, or binaries. You can manage both cloud-native and legacy software without rewriting existing tools or processes.

The **extensible design** of OCM makes it easy to adapt to emerging technologies, keeping your software supply chain future-proof.

### Community-Driven Approach

OCM is **committed to open source** and **welcomes contributions of any kind**. We work to keep OCM in line with the changing needs of the community. The design of OCM makes it easy to add new features, so anyone can suggest, review, and merge improvements in a transparent way.
