Software development is complex. Most organizations struggle with fragmented tools, complicated workflows, and the challenge of managing software across different environments - cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and even air-gapped networks.

Traditional approaches lead to:

- Complicated, custom CI/CD pipelines
- Inconsistent software delivery
- Difficulty tracking and securing software components
- Lack of a standard way to describe software and its artifacts

## What Makes a Modern Software Component Model?

### Unique and Immutable Component Identity

Every software component needs a permanent, globally unique ID. Think of it like a digital fingerprint that:

- Tracks the component across its entire lifecycle
- Helps correlate security scans, compliance checks, and deployments
- Provides a consistent reference point

### Comprehensive Artifact Description

The model should clearly outline:

- All technical artifacts needed to deploy a specific software version
- Precise access locations where these artifacts can be retrieved
- A complete "Software Bill of Delivery" (SBoD) that ensures nothing for a successful deployment is missed

### Separation of Component Identity and Artifact Location

Organizations often need to:

- Store artifacts in local registries
- Work in environments with limited or no internet access (air-gapped)
- Move artifacts between different systems and environments

The Component Identity must remain stable across all boundaries and system environments, while the artifact locations should be changeable. The ideal model separates the component identity from its artifact locations, allowing maximum flexibility.

### Technology Neutrality

Real-world software environments are messy. A good component model must:

- Support both modern containerized applications
- Handle legacy software
- Work across clouds, on-premises, and hybrid infrastructures

### Technology-Agnostic and Forward-Thinking Design

The model should:

- Adapt easily to emerging technologies
- Avoid constant rewrites of existing tools and processes
- Stay relevant as software development evolves
- Cover both legacy and modern software

### Built-In Security

Automatic capabilities for:

- Signing software components
- Verifying artifact integrity
- Protecting against tampering
- Maintaining trust across changing artifact locations
- Artifact locations should be changeable without affecting the signature

### Collaborative Potential

Enable teams to:

- Easily share and reuse trusted components
- Create a network of verifiable, high-quality software building blocks
- Simplify commercial software integration

## OCM: Solving Software Lifecycle Complexity

The Open Component Model (OCM) is designed to tackle these challenges head-on. It provides a standardized approach to describing, managing, and sharing software components that brings order to software lifecycle management. By linking additional metadata using OCMâ€™s identities, it facilitates asynchronous handling of various lifecycle management processes, such as compliance checks, security scans, deployments, and more, in a decoupled and streamlined manner.

Key Benefits:

- **Unique Component Identities:** OCM assigns an immutable, globally unique ID to each component, enabling seamless correlation across all lifecycle tools and processes.

- **Software Bill of Delivery:** OCM enables the specification of all artifacts required for delivering a software component. This compilation, termed a "Software Bill of Delivery" (SBoD), lists all artifacts and information how to access them.

- **Stable IDs, Changing Artifact Locations:** OCM separates immutable component IDs from the changeable artifact locations, essential for private and air-gapped environments.

- **Technology Agnosticism:** Being agnostic to implementation technologies like container images, NPM packages or binaries, OCM can handle both cloud-native and legacy apps.

- **Future-Proof Extensibility:** OCM's extensible design allows simple adaptation to emerging trends without disrupting existing tooling.

- **Trusted Signatures:** Built-in signing and verification ensure artifact integrity even as artifact locations change over time.

OCM creates a "single source of truth" for software artifacts. It streamlines compliance checks, security scans, and deployments by providing a consistent, location-independent way to identify, access, exchange, and verify software components.

By making software component management more transparent, secure, and efficient, OCM helps organizations transform their software delivery from a complicated puzzle into a smooth, manageable process.
