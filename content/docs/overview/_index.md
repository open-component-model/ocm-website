Discover the Open Component Model (OCM) - a model and toolkit for a secure delivery for sovereign clouds.

## What is the Overview?

The overview provides **explanation-oriented** introductions to OCM at a high level.
These pages answer fundamental questions: What is OCM? Why does it exist? What problems does it solve?
Unlike detailed concept explanations, the overview gives you the big picture before you dive into specifics.

## Prerequisites

To understand these overview articles, you should:

- Have basic knowledge of software delivery and deployment
- Understand common challenges in modern software supply chains
- Be familiar with concepts like containers, artifacts, and registries

No technical expertise or hands-on experience is required - this is a conceptual introduction.

## Learning Path

The overview follows the **explanation-oriented** approach from the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/).
It provides high-level context and motivation before you explore technical details.
Start here to understand OCM's purpose and value.

To begin working with OCM hands-on, try the [Getting Started]({{< relref "docs/getting-started/_index.md" >}}) guides.
For deeper technical understanding, explore the [Concepts]({{< relref "docs/concepts/_index.md" >}}) section. For information about the project structure, see the [About the OCM Project]({{< relref "docs/overview/project.md" >}}) page.
