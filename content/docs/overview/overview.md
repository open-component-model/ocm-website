## What is the Open Component Model?

 OCM is an open standard that's streamlining software lifecycle processes, like delivery and deployment as well as compliance.
 It's a reliable tool for secure, adaptable, and efficient software delivery.

- **Describe:** Define artefacts of software products in code. Sign them for uncompromised integrity.
- **Transport:** Unleash flexibility. From public cloud to on-prem or air-gapped, OCM ensures secure transport across boundaries.
- **Deploy:** Experience seamless automation. With built-in Flux integration, OCM makes GitOps deployment a breeze.
- **Beyond SBoM:** OCM is more than just another SBOM. It focuses on the parts necessary for delivery and deployment, introducing a new perspective on software delivery. We call it SBoD, Service Bill of Delivery.

**OCM - Your practical approach to the future of software delivery**

## Why use OCM?

- OCM components represent the Digital Twin of your deployments, intended to be the single source of truth.
- OCM component identities are unique and immutable.
- Access to the artifacts can be exchanged, e.g. OCM identity stays the same after transporting the OCM component from registry A to registry B.
- Decouple CI from CD. Let agile teams decide to use their own tool set and the central compliance and Ops teams another. The contract between them is OCM.
- Enables asynchronous operations using OCM components, e.g. compliance scans
- Link additional metadata, e.g. an SBoM or data gathered from compliance scans using OCM identities
