The most up-to-date version of the [OCM specification](https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm-spec/blob/main/README.md) offers you a deep insight to all technical details of the Open Component Model and explains model OCM is based on.

The available schema versions for OCM component descriptors are [v2](/schemas/component-descriptor-v2) ([Web Version](schema-v2.html)) and [v3alpha1](/schemas/component-descriptor-v3alpha1) ([Web Version](schema-v3alpha1.html)). There are no differences in the semantics between `v2` and `v3`. The "version" attribute is used as kind of moniker for different serializing/deserializing formats, e.g. `v3` has the format of Kubernetes resources.
