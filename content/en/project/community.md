## GitHub

You can stay updated with OCM's latest advancements, join our active conversations, and delve into our enhancement proposals on each project's GitHub issues page specifically for OCM.

If you're just starting with OCM, we recommend beginning with the 'good first issue' label in our repositories. 

Ready to contribute directly to OCM? Whether it's adding code, writing tests, or assisting with our documentation, please adhere to the guidelines provided in the 'contributing' documentation of the relevant OCM repository.

## Slack

Join [#open-component-model](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05UWBE8R1D) on Kubernetes Slack and talk to us and over 1,000 other community members.

(Note: If you aren't already a member on the Kubernetes Slack workspace, please request an invitation.)

Our team is passionate about delving into diverse deployment processes, exploring patterns, aiding in design, and troubleshooting issues. Who knows? Your inquiry might inspire the development of the next OCM feature!
