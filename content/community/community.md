## How to engage with us

The Open Component Model is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use to communicate and contribute:

### GitHub

Our GitHub repositories are the central hub for all project development. Connect with our codebase, report issues, submit pull requests, and follow our project's progress. New contributors can find issues labeled `good first issue` to get started, and our detailed [contribution guidelines](#contributing) will help you make your first successful submission.

### Slack

Join our [#open-component-model](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05UWBE8R1D) channel in the Kubernetes Slack workspace and connect with us and other community members.

{{<callout context="note" title="Kubernetes Slack Membership">}}If you aren't already a member in the Kubernetes Slack workspace, please request an [invitation](https://slack.k8s.io){{</callout>}}

Our team is passionate about delving into diverse deployment processes, exploring patterns, aiding in design, and troubleshooting issues. Who knows? Your inquiry might inspire the development of the next useful OCM feature!

At the same time we want our community to be diverse, helpful, collaborative and fun.

These calls are open to everyone and will be moderated by at least one OCM Core Maintainer.
We will answer anything you might bring up!

You can bring anything, including:

- Questions you have about the community or upcoming work
