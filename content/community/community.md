## How to engage with us

The Open Component Model is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use to communicate and contribute:

### GitHub

Our GitHub repositories are the central hub for all project development. Connect with our codebase, report issues, submit pull requests, and follow our project's progress. New contributors can find issues labeled `good first issue` to get started, and our detailed [contribution guidelines](#contributing) will help you make your first successful submission.

### Slack

Join our [#open-component-model](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05UWBE8R1D) channel in the Kubernetes Slack workspace and connect with us and other community members.

{{<callout context="note" title="Kubernetes Slack Membership">}}If you aren't already a member in the Kubernetes Slack workspace, please request an [invitation](https://slack.k8s.io){{</callout>}}

Our team is passionate about delving into diverse deployment processes, exploring patterns, aiding in design, and troubleshooting issues. Who knows? Your inquiry might inspire the development of the next useful OCM feature!

### Community Calls

We're excited to announce our regular community calls:

#### Schedule

- **Frequency**: Every first Wednesday of the months
- **Time**: 16:00-17:00 UTC (17:00-18:00 CET, 11:00-12:00 EST, 08:00-09:00 PST)
- **Duration**: 1 hour

#### Call History

[This page](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/blob/main/docs/community/README.md) contains the history of the Open Component Model community calls and links to slides and recordings.

#### What to Expect

Join us to see and discuss project updates, share your feedback, ask questions, and connect with other community members.
The community calls should be an open discussion space and give a voice to any interested stakeholder.
At the same time we want our community to be diverse, helpful, collaborative and fun.

These calls are open to everyone and will be moderated by at least one OCM Core Maintainer.
We will answer anything you might bring up!

#### What to Bring

We want to hear from you! This is your chance to share your thoughts and ideas with the community.
You can bring anything, including:

- Ideas how to make OCM better
- Issues you would like to talk about and that should be addressed
- Concepts you would like to work on together
- Questions you have about the community or upcoming work

## Contributing

We welcome community contributions! Please see the [Contributing Guideline](https://github.com/open-component-model/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to submit changes. If you are planning on making more elaborate or potentially controversial changes, please discuss them with the maintainers in the [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C05UWBE8R1D) before sending a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

To make OCM a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, we follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

## Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

OCM grows when people build together — and our Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are where ideas turn into impact.

SIGs are focused working groups that take ownership of a specific area of the project and move it forward.

Following the example of other CNCF projects, we defined a framework for SIGs to help contributors collaborate effectively.

The **[SIG Handbook](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/blob/main/docs/community/SIGs/SIG-Handbook.md)** covers:

- goals and motivation behind SIGs
- roles and responsibilities
- how to propose, establish, and run a SIG

> **Status:** We’re in the kick-off phase — there are no active SIGs *yet*. That’s your chance to shape the very first ones! As SIGs form, we’ll list them here.

### How to get involved

- **Curious?** Start with the [SIG Handbook](https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/blob/main/docs/community/SIGs/SIG-Handbook.md).  
- **Have a topic in mind?** Follow the handbook’s steps to **propose a SIG** and gather interested contributors.  
- **Prefer to join later?** Keep an eye on this page — we’ll announce and list new SIGs here.

## Security Guideline

In case you want to report any security vulnerabilities inside the Open Component Model project,
please do not report them through public GitHub issues.

Please visit the [Open Source Security Policy](https://github.com/open-component-model/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more information.
