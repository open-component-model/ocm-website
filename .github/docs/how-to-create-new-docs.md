# How to Create and Test Content for the OCM Website

## üéØ Objective and Summary

This document describes how to create and test new content for our OCM website, including importing content from other repositories, e.g. `ocm` or `open-component-model` using Hugo modules.

The website utilizes:

- **Frontmatter** for each document to define metadata like title, description, and logo. The templates are stored in `.github/templates/`.
- **Version Branches** (e.g., `releases/website/v1.0`) for each released version of the website. New content is created in branch `main`, and then branched to the respective website version branch when we release a new OCM version. Corrections and updates to existing content are made in the `main`branch and then cherry-picked into the release branch.
- **Hugo Modules** to include the reference documentation for CLI, APIs and other content from other repositories.

## üìö Content Creation

### üìù Frontmatter

Each page in the website MUST have a frontmatter section at the top of the file, which defines the metadata for that page. This is required for Hugo to work correctly. The frontmatter should include:

```yaml
title: "Page Title"
description: "A brief description of the page content"
logo: "üìÑ"  # Optional, but highly recommended. Can be an emoji or icon representing the page on its section page.
weight: 92  # Optional, used to order the pages in the sidebar. Leave it out for default ordering.
```

The templates for the frontmatter are stored in `.github/docs/templates/`. You can use these templates to ensure consistency across all pages.

### üìÇ Section Pages and Normal Content Pages

A section page is a special type of content page that serves as a landing page for a specific section of the website. Each section of the website SHOULD be organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate. The content MUST be written in Markdown and placed in the appropriate directory under `content/`. Each section has its own subdirectory, and you can use the frontmatter to define title, description and logo for each page.

`Sections` are created by adding new directories under `content/docs`, and each page within those sections has its own Markdown file with the appropriate frontmatter. The section itself REQUIRES an `_index.md` file with frontmatter to define the section title and description. There MUST NOT be any additional content in the `_index.md` file, as it is only used for metadata and navigation purposes.

`Normal content` pages are created by adding Markdown files within specific section directories. Each page should have its own frontmatter to define its title, description, and other metadata.

### üîó Import Content from other locations

*Adding new references to other repositories is a very rare action. Most-likely we will only have two referenced modules, one for the CLI and one for the controllers.*

A new module MUST only be created in combination a new website version. To include a new references you can use Hugo modules. The configuration is done in `config/_default/module.toml`. You can define the modules to be used and where they should be mounted in the website. Here's an example for the OCM CLI reference documentation:

```toml
[[imports]]
path = "ocm.software/open-component-model/cli"
  [[imports.mounts]]
    source = "docs/reference"
    target = "content/docs/reference/ocm-cli"

### not available yet, but planned
#[[imports]]
#path = "ocm.software/open-component-model/kubernetes/controller"
#  [[imports.mounts]]
#    source = "docs/reference"
#    target = "content/docs/reference/ocm-controller"
```

This configuration mounts the `docs/reference` directory from the OCM CLI repository into the `content/docs/reference/ocm-cli` directory of the website. You can add multiple modules as needed.

To define the version of the module and persist it in the `go.mod` file, you need to fetch the correct version of the referenced module first. You MUST know what module version matches the version of the website you are creating a version branch for.

Run `hugo mod get <module>@<version>` for the wanted version of the referenced module(s):

```sh
hugo mod get ocm.software/open-component-model/cli@v1.0
hugo mod tidy
```

## üß™ Test Your Changes Locally

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Requirements

- Node.js >=22.12.0
- npm >=10.9.0
- Hugo (will be installed via npm, currently pinned to version `0.145.0` due to incompatible changes in later versions)

To be able to test your changes with a locally running Hugo server, install EXACTLY the dependencies defined for the current version (npm is using the file `package-lock.json`):

```sh
npm ci
```

### Test Website - ONLY for the current version

To test your changes locally - ONLY for the version you currently work on - run:

```sh
npm run build
npm run dev
```

This will build the current version of the site and start a local Hugo server at <http://localhost:1313>. Hugo will not use the `public/` directory, but will build the site in memory and serve it from there. Changes to the content will be reflected immediately in the browser without needing to rebuild the site.

### Test Website - Multi-Version Website

To test your changes on the complete website including all versions, you can use the multi-version build script. This will build all versions of the website in parallel and store the output in the `public/` directory. You can then run a local server to test the version switcher and navigation.

```sh
npm run build-multi-version
npx http-server ./public --port 1313
```

This will build all website versions in parallel and store the output in the `public/` directory, so you can test the version switcher and navigation locally on <http://localhost:1313>.

## üìù Commit & Pull Request Workflow

After updating and testing content, you MUST commit your changes with a clear message indicating what was changed. All changes are done in the `main` branch using PRs. A new release of the website will include all changes made in the `main` branch since the last release and merge it into the respective version branch.

In case of required corrections to already released content, the changes are made in the `releases/website/vx.y` branch and then cherry-picked into the `main` branch if required.

- Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message, e.g.:

  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "docs: add new section on authentication"
  git push
  ```

- Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch (or in case of a version branch against the respective `releases/website/vx.y` branch).
- In the PR description, summarize your changes and reference any related issues.
- Assign reviewers as needed.

## üöÄ What Happens When You Open a PR?

When you open a PR, a Netlify deploy preview is automatically generated. This preview uses the multi-version build script to build the complete website, including all versions. You will see a link to the deploy preview in the PR checks section.

This allows you and reviewers to test your changes on the fully rendered multi-version website before merging. Please verify:

- Your changes appear as expected in the preview
- The version switcher works correctly
- Navigation and content are correct across all versions

If you find any issues, update your PR and the preview will be rebuilt automatically.

## üö® Troubleshooting

- If the build fails, check the error messages in your terminal.
- Run `npm run lint:markdown` to check for formatting issues.
- Make sure your frontmatter is valid YAML.
