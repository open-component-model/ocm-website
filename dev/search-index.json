OCM works everywhere — cloud, on-premises, hybrid, and air-gapped environments. OCM integrates seamlessly with your existing tools and is easy to extend. With OCM, you gain control, reduce risk, and keep your delivery approach adaptable.\nWhy choose OCM Create a Software Bill of Delivery With OCM, you can describe everything you deliver in a unified, machine-readable format. This enables you to create a Software Bill of Delivery (SBoD). Unlike a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), which lists all components inside an application, a Software Bill of Delivery focuses on everything you need for a successful deployment — including container images, Helm charts, configuration files, and binaries. It is a complete, verifiable record of all deliverables and how to access them.\nProtect Your Supply Chain Security is built into OCM. You can cryptographically sign and verify every component in your supply chain to ensure its integrity or confirm its provenance.\nBeyond signatures, OCM uses immutable, globally unique component identities. These act like tracking IDs, linking all lifecycle phases. They make compliance checks, audits, and vulnerability scans easier and more reliable. With OCM, your software is fully traceable from build to deployment.\nDeploy Anywhere, Even Air-Gapped You can deliver across boundaries and deploy anywhere — public cloud, on-premises, or air-gapped environments. OCM separates the identity of software artifacts from their location. Identities remain stable while locations can change as needed. You can store software artifacts in local registries, move them between systems, and work in environments with limited or no internet access — all without losing integrity or traceability.\nWorks with Your Existing Tools OCM seamlessly integrates with your current ecosystem. It is compatible with any implementation technology, whether container images, NPM packages, or binaries. You can manage both cloud-native and legacy software without rewriting existing tools or processes.\nAdapts to Your Needs OCM is built for flexibility. Its plugin system lets you extend functionality without changing the core. You can integrate new technologies, customize workflows, and scale from small teams to enterprise environments. OCM ensures that your supply chain remains agile and future-proof.\nCommitted to Open Source OCM has open development and transparent governance. We welcome contributions of any kind. The design of OCM makes it easy to add new features, so anyone can suggest, review, and merge improvements in a transparent way.\nOur commitment to open source goes beyond OCM. We are active members of the open-source community and have maintainers in projects such as kro, Flux, and External Secrets Operator. We believe in open source and work to shape its future.\nTry OCM Out Does OCM sound like the right fit for your project?

While we\u0026rsquo;re working on providing pre-built releases through various package managers and distribution channels, the only way to install the OCM CLI right now is to build it from source.\nThis guide will walk you through building the OCM CLI from the source code and configuring the necessary credentials.\nBuild from Source Step 1: Clone the Repository First, clone the OCM repository from GitHub:\ngit clone https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model\rStep 2: Navigate to the CLI Directory Change into the CLI directory:\ncd open-component-model/cli\rStep 3: Build the CLI Use the Task build tool to compile the OCM CLI:\ntask build\rAfter the build completes successfully, you should see output similar to:\ntask: [build] ln -sf /path/to/your/open-component-model/cli/tmp/bin/ocm-\u0026lt;os\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;arch\u0026gt; /path/to/your/open-component-model/cli/tmp/bin/ocm\rThe exact path will vary depending on your system and where you cloned the repository.\nUsing the OCM CLI Once the build is complete, you have three options for using the OCM CLI:\nOption 1: Create a Permanent Alias Add an alias to your shell configuration file for permanent access:\nFor Zsh users (~/.zshrc):\necho \u0026#39;alias ocm=\u0026#34;/path/to/your/open-component-model/cli/tmp/bin/ocm\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.zshrc source ~/.zshrc\rFor Bash users (~/.bashrc):\necho \u0026#39;alias ocm=\u0026#34;/path/to/your/open-component-model/cli/tmp/bin/ocm\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc\rReplace /path/to/your/ with the actual path where you cloned the repository.\nOption 2: Create a Session Alias For temporary use in your current terminal session:\nalias ocm=\u0026#34;/path/to/your/open-component-model/cli/tmp/bin/ocm\u0026#34;\rOption 3: Use the Full Path You can also run the OCM CLI directly using the full path:\n/path/to/your/open-component-model/cli/tmp/bin/ocm\rVerify Installation To verify that the OCM CLI is working correctly, run:\nocm version\rThis should display the version information and confirm that the installation was successful.\nConfigure the OCM Command Line Client Credentials to be used by the OCM CLI can be configured by supplying it with a configuration file. By default, the CLI looks for the file in $HOME/.ocmconfig.\nUsing the Docker Configuration File The easiest way to configure credentials for the OCM CLI is to reuse an existing Docker configuration json file.\nCreate a file named .ocmconfig in your home directory with the following content:\ntype: generic.config.ocm.software/v1 configurations: - type: credentials.config.ocm.software repositories: - repository: type: DockerConfig/v1 # The path to the Docker configuration file dockerConfigFile: \u0026#34;~/.docker/config.json\u0026#34; propagateConsumerIdentity: true - type: attributes.config.ocm.software attributes: cache: ~/.ocm/cache\rUsing Basic Authentication Alternatively, you can use basic authentication. Create a file named .ocmconfig with the following content in your home directory:\ntype: generic.config.ocm.software/v1 configurations: - type: credentials.config.ocm.software consumers: - identity: type: ociRegistry hostname: \u0026lt;YOUR-REGISTRY\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;YOUR-REPO\u0026gt; # e.g. ghcr.io/acme/acme credentials: - type: Credentials properties: username: \u0026lt;YOUR-USERNAME\u0026gt; password: \u0026lt;YOUR-PASSWORD\u0026gt;\rMore information on how to deal with credentials can be found in this guide with many examples for different repository types.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Now that you have the OCM CLI installed and configured, you can start exploring its capabilities. Check out our Getting Started Guides to learn how to use the OCM CLI to work with your component.\nFuture Installation Methods We\u0026rsquo;re actively working on providing more convenient installation methods, including:\nHomebrew packages Docker images Pre-built binaries for GitHub Releases and more Stay tuned for updates as we continue to improve the installation experience!\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":6,"permalink":"/dev/docs/getting-started/installation/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe new major version of the OCM CLI is currently under active development.

The file describes the components and their artifacts - resources and sources, metadata in form of labels and references to other components.\nComponent versions are locally stored in archives using the Common Transfer Format (CTF). A CTF archive may contain any number of component versions and is used to transfer components to and between component repositories.\nNote that a CTF archive itself is also an OCM repository, so it can be used as source or target for component transfer operations using the OCM CLI.\nThe command ocm add component-version directly creates a component version from a component-constructor.yaml file and stores it in a local CTF archive.\nCreate a Component Version In this example, we will use the the ocm CLI tool to create a very basic component version that contains a local resource and a resource that is accessed from a remote location. The local resource is an arbitrary file that we will create from scratch the remote resource is a Docker image stored in an OCI registry.\nOCM components can contain any kind of resource, including Helm charts, Docker images, any content from local file systems, and more. Take a look at the tutorial about Input and Access Types to see how to define and use different resource types.\nStart by creating a test folder where we will execute all required steps for this example, and then navigate into it:\nmkdir /tmp/helloworld cd /tmp/helloworld\rQuickly create a simple test file with some content in:\necho \u0026#34;My first local Resource for an OCM component\u0026#34; \u0026gt; my-local-resource.txt\rNow, create a file named component-constructor.yaml. This file will define all elements of your component. In our example, the component contains a local file and a remote Docker image as resources.\nTo create the example component, save the following YAML configuration to component-constructor.yaml:\n# specify a schema to validate the configuration and get auto-completion in your editor # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://ocm.software/schemas/configuration-schema.yaml components: - name: github.com/acme.org/helloworld # version needs to follow \u0026#34;relaxed\u0026#34; SemVer version: 1.0.0 provider: name: acme.org resources: # local file resource - name: mylocalfile type: blob input: type: file path: ./my-local-resource.txt # remote image resource - name: image type: ociImage version: 1.0.0 access: type: ociArtifact imageReference: ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.9.1\rYou can use our public configuration schema to validate the configuration. The schema is available at https://ocm.software/schemas/configuration-schema.yaml and can be used in your editor to validate the configuration (e.g., in Visual Studio Code).\nComponent versions need to have at least a name, version and provider attribute. All other attributes are optional. Check out an example component descriptor or the OCM Specification to see all available attributes.\nA resource is described either by its access information to a remote repository or by locally provided resources.\nFor remote access, the field access is used to describe the access method. The type field is used to specify the kind of access.\nIf the resource content is taken from local resources, the field input is used to specify the access to the local resources. Similarly to the access attribute, the kind of the input source is described by the field type.\nAvailable access and input types are described in the tutorial about Input and Access Types.\nAdd Component Version to CTF archive To store our component version locally and to make it transportable, add it to a CTF archive using the following command:\nocm add component-version\ror the short form (which we will use from now on):\nocm add cv\rThis is the most basic form of the command. When executed, the OCM CLI defaults the constructor file name to component-constructor.yaml and the CTF archive name to transport-archive. If the CTF archive doesn’t exist yet, it will be created automatically.\nIf you want to specify a different constructor file name or CTF archive name, you can use the --constructor and --repository flags.\nocm add cv --repository /path/to/my-own-ctf -c /path/to/my-component-constructor.yaml\r... component github.com/acme.org/helloworld/1.0.0 constructed ... done!

What should I know before I start? You should be familiar with the following concepts:\nOpen Component Model Kubernetes ecosystem kro Kubernetes resource deployer such as FluxCD. Concept The following section provides a high-level overview of the OCM Controllers and their components regarding the deployment of an OCM resource in a very basic scenario. To learn more about the transfer of OCM component versions, please take a look at its architecture document.\nThe primary purpose of OCM Controllers is simple: Deploy an OCM resource from an OCM component version into a Kubernetes cluster.\nThe implementation, however, is a bit more complex as deployments must be secure and configurable. Additionally, an OCM Resource can, in theory, contain any form of deployable resource, for instance a Helm chart, a Kustomization, or plain Kubernetes manifests. Each of these resources has its own way of being deployed or configured. So, instead of creating a generic deployer that offers all these functionalities, we decided to use existing tools that are already available in the Kubernetes ecosystem.\nThe following diagram describes a basic scenario in which an OCM resource containing a Helm chart is deployed into a Kubernetes cluster using the OCM Controllers as well as kro and FluxCD. kro is used to orchestrate the deployment and to transport information about the location of the OCM resource to FluxCD. FluxCD takes the location of the OCM resource, downloads the chart, configures it if necessary, and deploys it into the Kubernetes cluster.\nflowchart TB classDef cluster fill:white,color:black,stroke:black; classDef reconciledBy fill:#dedede,stroke:black,stroke-dasharray: 5,color:black; classDef k8sObject fill:#b3b3b3,color:black,stroke:black; classDef information fill:#b3b3b3,color:black,stroke:black,stroke-dasharray: 2; classDef ocm fill:white,stroke:black,color:black; classDef legendStyle fill:white,stroke:black,color:black,stroke-dasharray: 2; classDef legendStartEnd height:0px; classDef legendItems fill:#b3b3b3,stroke:none,color:black; subgraph legend[Legend] start1[ ] ---references[referenced by] --\u0026gt; end1[ ] start2[ ] -.-creates -.-\u0026gt; end2[ ] start3[ ] ---instanceOf[instance of] --\u0026gt; end3[ ] start4[ ] ~~~reconciledBy[reconciled by] ~~~ end4[ ] start5[ ] ~~~k8sObject[k8s object] ~~~ end5[ ] start6[ ] ~~~templateOf[template of] ~~~ end6[ ] end subgraph background[ ] direction TB subgraph ocmRepo[OCM Repository] subgraph ocmCV[OCM Component Version] subgraph ocmResource[OCM Resource: HelmChart] end end end subgraph k8sCluster[Kubernetes Cluster] subgraph kroRGD[kro] subgraph rgd[RGD: Simple] direction LR rgdRepository[Repository] rgdComponent[Component] rgdResourceHelm[Resource: HelmChart] rgdSource[FluxCD: OCI Repository] rgdHelmRelease[FluxCD: HelmRelease] end end subgraph kroInstance[kro] subgraph instanceSimple[Instance: Simple] subgraph ocmControllers[OCM Controllers] k8sRepo[Repository] --\u0026gt; k8sComponent[Component] --\u0026gt; k8sResource[Resource: HelmChart] end subgraph fluxCD[FluxCD] source[OCI Repository] --\u0026gt; helmRelease[HelmRelease] end k8sResource --\u0026gt; source end end kroRGD \u0026amp; instanceSimple --\u0026gt; crdSimple[CRD: Simple] helmRelease --\u0026gt; deployment[Deployment: Helm chart] end ocmRepo --\u0026gt; k8sRepo end linkStyle default fill:none,stroke:black; linkStyle 2,3,16,18 stroke:black,stroke-dasharray: 10; linkStyle 4,5,17 stroke:black,stroke-dasharray: 4; class start1,end1,start2,end2,start3,end3,start4,end4,start5,end5,start6,end6 legendStartEnd; class references,creates,instanceOf legendItems; class templateOf,rgdRepository,rgdComponent,rgdResourceHelm,rgdSource,rgdHelmRelease information; class reconciledBy,ocmK8sToolkit,fluxCD,kroRGD,kroInstance reconciledBy; class k8sObject,rgd,k8sRepo,k8sComponent,k8sResource,source,helmRelease,deployment,crdSimple,instanceSimple k8sObject; class ocmRepo,ocmCV,ocmResource ocm; class k8sCluster cluster; class legend legendStyle; The above diagram shows an OCM resource of type helmChart. This resource is part of an OCM component version, which is located in an OCM repository.\nIn the Kubernetes Cluster we can see several Kubernetes (custom) resources. The ResourceGraphDefintion (RGD: Simple) contains the template of all the resources for deploying the Helm chart into the Kubernetes cluster. kro creates a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Simple based on that ResourceGraphDefinition. By creating an instance of this CRD (Instance: Simple), the resources are created and reconciled by the respective controllers:\nRepository: Points to the OCM repository and checks if it is reachable by pinging it. Component: Refers to the Repository and downloads and verifies the OCM component version descriptor. Resource: Points to the Component, downloads the OCM component version descriptor from which it gets the location of the OCM resource. It then downloads the resource to verify its signature (optional) and publishes the location of the resource in its status. With FluxCD, this only works if the OCM resource has an access for which FluxCD has a corresponding Source type (e.g. an OCI or a GitHub repository)\nAs a result, FluxCD can now consume the information of the Resource and deploy the Helm chart:\nOCIRepository: Watches and downloads the resource from the location provided by the Resource status. HelmRelease: Refers to the OCIRepository, lets you configure the Helm chart, and creates the deployment into the Kubernetes cluster. Installation Currently, the OCM Controllers are available as image and Kustomization. A Helm chart is planned for the future.\nTo install the OCM Controllers into your running Kubernetes cluster, you can use the following commands:\n# In the open-component-model repository, folder kubernetes/controller task deploy or\nkubectl apply -k https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/kubernetes/controller/config/default?ref=main While the OCM Controllers technically can be used standalone, it requires kro and a deployer, e.g. FluxCD, to deploy an OCM resource into a Kubernetes cluster. The OCM Controllers deployment, however, does not contain kro or any deployer. Please refer to the respective installation guides for these tools:\nkro FluxCD Getting Started Setup your (test) environment with kind, kro, and FluxCD Deploying a Helm chart using a ResourceGraphDefinition with FluxCD Deploying a Helm chart using a ResourceGraphDefinition inside the OCM component version (bootstrap) with FluxCD Configuring credentials for OCM Controllers resources to access private OCM repositories ","date":"0001-01-01","id":14,"permalink":"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/introduction/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"callout callout-danger d-flex flex-row mt-4 mb-4 pt-4 pe-4 pb-2 ps-3\"\u003e\r\n  \r\n  \u003cdiv class=\"callout-content\"\u003e\r\n    \r\n    \u003cdiv class=\"callout-body\"\u003e\r\n      \u003cp\u003eThis project is in early development and not yet ready for production use.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Introduction"},{"content":"This document describes how to set up a local environment for testing and running examples from the examples/ directory or the getting-started guides.\nPrerequisites kubectl ocm CLI (will not be used in this guide, but is required to follow the examples and getting-started guides) Start a local Kubernetes cluster with kind You don\u0026rsquo;t need to run kind if you are using a remote Kubernetes cluster you have access to.

Access to a registry As all examples and guides will create an OCM component version that will be consumed by the OCM Controllers, you will need access to a registry. You can either choose a public registry like ghcr.io or deploy a registry (like registry, zot, \u0026hellip;) into your Kubernetes cluster.\nIf you choose to deploy a registry into your Kubernetes cluster, you have to make sure it is accessible from outside the cluster (for ocm transfer to work) and inside the cluster (for the OCM Controllers to work).\nWe strongly recommend to use a registry that is publicly accessible, like [ghcr.io][ghcr.io]. (Deploying your own registry requires a lot of additional configuration. Especially, if you want to try out the localization example, you will need to configure a registry that is accessible with the same address from your CLI, kubelet, and inside the cluster.)\nIf you completed all of the above steps, you are ready to go. You can now play around with the examples in the examples/ directory or follow the Getting Started Guides.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":15,"permalink":"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/set-up-your-environment/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis document describes how to set up a local environment for testing and running examples from the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/open-component-model/open-component-model/tree/main/kubernetes/controller/examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eexamples/\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e directory or the \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://ocm.software/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/\"\u003egetting-started guides\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Set up your environment"},{"content":"This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Helm Chart from an OCM component version using OCM Controllers, kro, and FluxCD. It is a rather basic example, in which it is assumed that a developer created an application, packaged it as a Helm chart, and publishes it as OCM component version in an OCI registry. Then, an operator who wants to deploy the application via Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster, creates a ResourceGraphDefinition with resources that point to this OCM component version. Using CEL expressions inside the ResourceGraphDefinition, the information about the resource location will be passed to FluxCD, which will then configure the Helm chart and deploy it into the Kubernetes cluster.\nBefore starting, make sure you have set up your environment as described in the setup guide.\nCreate the OCM component version First, we will create an OCM component version containing a Helm chart. For this example, we will use the podinfo Helm chart, which is a simple web application that serves a pod information page. For more details on how to create an OCM component version, please refer to the OCM documentation.\nTo create the OCM component version, we will use the following component-constructor.yaml file:\ncomponents: - name: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple provider: name: ocm.software version: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34; resources: - name: helm-resource type: helmChart version: 1.0.0 access: type: ociArtifact imageReference: \u0026#34;ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo:6.9.1@sha256:565d310746f1fa4be7f93ba7965bb393153a2d57a15cfe5befc909b790a73f8a\u0026#34;\rAfter creating the file, we can create the OCM component version:\nocm add componentversion --create --file ./ctf component-constructor.yaml\rThis will create a local CTF (Component Transfer Format) directory ./ctf containing the OCM component version. Since the OCM component version must be accessible for the OCM Controllers, we will transfer the CTF to a registry. For this example, we will use GitHub\u0026rsquo;s container registry, but you can use any OCI registry:\nocm transfer ctf ./ctf ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;\rIf you are using a registry that requires authentication, you need to provide credentials for ocm. Please refer to the [OCM CLI credentials documentation][ocm-credentials] for more information on how to set up and use credentials.\nIf everything went well, you should see the following output:\nocm get componentversion ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;//ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple:1.0.0\rCOMPONENT VERSION PROVIDER ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple 1.0.0 ocm.software Deploy the Helm Chart To deploy the Helm chart from the OCM component version, we will first create a ResourceGraphDefinition that contains all required resources. Additionally, we will add a configuration to the HelmRelease resource that can be passed through the instance of that ResourceGraphDefinition. After the ResourceGraphDefinition is created and applied, we create the instance of the ResourceGraphDefinition that will deploy the Helm chart.\nCreate and apply the ResourceGraphDefinition The ResourceGraphDefinition is a custom resource that defines all the resources that should be applied. To proceed with the example, create a file named rgd.yaml and add the following content:\napiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1 kind: ResourceGraphDefinition metadata: name: simple spec: schema: apiVersion: v1alpha1 # The name of the CRD that is created by this ResourceGraphDefinition when applied kind: Simple spec: # This spec defines values that can be referenced in the ResourceGraphDefinition and that can be set in the # instances of this ResourceGraphDefinition. # We will use it to pass a value to the Helm chart and configure the message the application shows # (see resource HelmRelease). message: string | default=\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; resources: # Repository points to the OCM repository in which the OCM component version is stored and checks if it is # reachable by pinging it. - id: repository template: apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Repository metadata: name: simple-repository spec: repositorySpec: baseUrl: ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; type: OCIRegistry interval: 1m # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it. # ocmConfig: # Component refers to the Repository, downloads and verifies the OCM component version descriptor. - id: component template: apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Component metadata: name: simple-component spec: repositoryRef: name: ${repository.metadata.name} component: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/simple semver: 1.0.0 interval: 1m # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it. # ocmConfig: # Resource points to the Component, downloads the resource passed by reference-name and verifies it.

You can do this by uncommenting the ocmConfig fields in the Repository, Component, and Resource resources and providing the necessary credentials. For more information on how to set up and pass the credentials, please check out the guide configure credentials for OCM Controller resources.\nBe aware that FluxCD\u0026rsquo;s OCIRepository also needs access to the OCI registry that contains the Helm chart. However, OCIRepository only accepts imagePullSecrets in the same namespace. If you want to use the same credentials for FluxCD and for the OCM Controller resources, create a Kubernetes secret of type dockerconfigjson and keep all the resources in the same namespace.\nAfter creating the file rgd.yaml with the above content and adjusting Repository\u0026rsquo;s baseUrl to point to your OCM repository, you can apply the ResourceGraphDefinition to your Kubernetes cluster:\nkubectl apply -f rgd.yaml\rIf everything went well, you should see the following output:\nkubectl get rgd\rNAME APIVERSION KIND STATE AGE simple v1alpha1 Simple Active 19s This creates a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) Simple that can be used to create instances.

If so, you might see an error like the following:\nfailed to list versions: failed to list tags: GET \u0026#34;https://ghcr.io/v2...\u0026#34;: response status code 401: unauthorized: authentication required You can resolve this issue by making the package public or by providing credentials to the respective resources.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":16,"permalink":"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/deploying-a-helm-chart/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis guide demonstrates how to deploy a Helm Chart from an OCM component version using OCM Controllers, kro, and FluxCD.\nIt is a rather basic example, in which it is assumed that a developer created an application, packaged it as a Helm\nchart, and publishes it as OCM component version in an OCI registry.

By defining a ResourceGraphDefinition that contains all the required resources to deploy the Helm chart into a Kubernetes cluster.\nHowever, there are scenarios, where the developer already knows how the deployment instructions for the Helm chart should look like and what should be configured. Accordingly, the developer can create a ResourceGraphDefinition that contains all the required resources to deploy and configure the Helm chart, and deliver it with the OCM component version itself. This way, the deployment instructions can also be delivered securely through OCM and the operator does not need to know which resources are required.\nIn such a case, we need to bootstrap the ResourceGraphDefinition from the OCM component and apply it to the cluster.\nTo do so, we use the OCM Controller resource Deployer. By referencing the Resource containing the ResourceGraphDefinition by name, the deployer will download the content from the OCM component and apply it to the cluster.\nThe following guide demonstrates how to deploy a Helm chart using a ResourceGraphDefinition that is also delivered with the same OCM component. Additionally, it shows how to localize a Helm chart.\nLocalization describes the process of inserting a new image reference into the deployment instructions, e.g. a Helm chart. It is a two-step process:\nWhen an OCM component and its resources are transferred to another registry, referential resources can potentially update their reference to the new location. For instance, a resource with an access type ociArtifact will update its image reference in the component descriptor to the new registry location, if the OCM transfer is done with the flag --copy-resources. However, the deployment using the image is not aware of this change. Accordingly, we need to insert the new image reference into the deployment instruction. This can be done using deployment tools like FluxCDs HelmRelease and Kustomization or ArgoCDs Helm and Kustomize.

An OCM Resource containing an access specification to an \u0026ldquo;Image\u0026rdquo; we want to use for the deployment and localization. An OCM Resource containing the ResourceGraphDefinition (RGD) that will deploy the Helm chart and configure the localization. To enable the bootstrap of the ResourceGraphDefinition, we will create the respective OCM Controller resources that point to the OCM repository (\u0026ldquo;Repository\u0026rdquo;), the OCM component version (\u0026ldquo;Component\u0026rdquo;), and the OCM Resource (\u0026ldquo;Resource: RGD\u0026rdquo;) that contains the ResourceGraphDefinition. The OCM Controller resource \u0026ldquo;Deployer\u0026rdquo; will refer to the aforementioned \u0026ldquo;Resource: RGD\u0026rdquo;, download the ResourceGraphDefinition, and apply it to the cluster.\nAfter applying the ResourceGraphDefinition, kro will reconcile it and create a Custom Resource Definition (\u0026ldquo;CRD: Bootstrap\u0026rdquo;). By creating an instance of that CRD, we will deploy the resources as defined in the ResourceGraphDefinition:\nAn OCM Controller resource \u0026ldquo;HelmChart\u0026rdquo; of type Resource that contains the location of the Helm chart in its status. An OCM Controller resource \u0026ldquo;Image\u0026rdquo; of type Resource that contains the localized image reference in its status. A FluxCD resource of type OCIRepository that points to the location of the Helm chart retrieved from the status of the resource \u0026ldquo;HelmChart\u0026rdquo;. A FluxCD resource of type HelmRelease that points to FluxCDs OCIRepository, gets the Helm chart, and replaces the image location in the deployment using its spec.values-field and the status of the resource \u0026ldquo;Image\u0026rdquo; that contains the localized image reference. Finally, we will check if the deployment was successful and if the localization was applied correctly.\nBefore starting, make sure you have set up your environment as described in the setup guide.\nCreate the OCM component version First, we will create an OCM component version containing a Helm chart, the application image that is used in the Helm chart, and the ResourceGraphDefinition that contains all required resource to deploy the Helm chart and configure the localization. For this example, we will use the podinfo Helm chart and image, which is a simple web application that serves a pod information page. For more details on how to create an OCM component version, please refer to the OCM documentation.\nTo create the OCM component version, we will use the following component-constructor.yaml file:\ncomponents: - name: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap version: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34; provider: name: ocm.software resources: - name: helm-resource type: helmChart version: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34; access: type: ociArtifact imageReference: \u0026#34;ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo:6.9.1@sha256:565d310746f1fa4be7f93ba7965bb393153a2d57a15cfe5befc909b790a73f8a\u0026#34; - name: image-resource type: ociArtifact version: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34; access: type: ociRegistry imageReference: \u0026#34;ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.9.1@sha256:262578cde928d5c9eba3bce079976444f624c13ed0afb741d90d5423877496cb\u0026#34; - name: resource-graph-definition type: blob version: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34; input: type: file path: ./resourceGraphDefinition.yaml\rAs you can see, the resource resource-graph-definition is of type blob and contains the path to a file resourceGraphDefinition.yaml.

Accordingly, you have to specify the ocmConfig field in the Resource resources and the secretRef field in the OCIRepository.\nIf you want to use the same credentials for FluxCD and for the OCM Controller resources, create a Kubernetes secret of type dockerconfigjson and keep all the resources in the same namespace.\nAfter creating both files, we can create the OCM component version using the following command:\nocm add componentversion --create --file ./ctf component-constructor.yaml\rThis will create a local CTF (Component Transfer Format) directory ./ctf containing the OCM component version. Since the OCM component version must be accessible for the OCM Controllers, we will transfer the CTF to a registry. For this example, we will use GitHub\u0026rsquo;s container registry, but you can use any OCI registry. Additionally, we will use the flag --copy-resources to make sure that all referential resources, for instance the Helm chart, will be localized in the first step - so, the image reference is updated to the new registry location:\nocm transfer ctf --copy-resources ./ctf ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;\rIf you are using a registry that requires authentication, you need to provide credentials for ocm. Please refer to the [OCM CLI credentials documentation][ocm-credentials] for more information on how to set up and use credentials.\nIf everything went well, you should see the following output:\nocm get componentversion ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;//ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap:1.0.0 -o yaml | yq .component.resources\r# Output is truncated for brevity - access: imageReference: ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo:6.9.1@sha256:565d310746f1fa4be7f93ba7965bb393153a2d57a15cfe5befc909b790a73f8a type: ociArtifact digest: ... name: helm-resource relation: external type: helmChart version: 1.0.0 - access: imageReference: ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.9.1@sha256:262578cde928d5c9eba3bce079976444f624c13ed0afb741d90d5423877496cb type: ociArtifact digest: ... name: image-resource relation: external type: ociArtifact version: 1.0.0 - access: localReference: sha256:ed5252ff70bfe93e763ff6afeafe8dafd14c128981e4ae1472e35afc3ebe7a63 mediaType: application/octet-stream type: localBlob digest: ... name: resource-graph-definition relation: local type: blob version: 1.0.0\rDeploy the Helm Chart To deploy the Helm chart from the OCM component, we first need to create all resources that are required to bootstrap the ResourceGraphDefinition from the OCM component. Afterwards, we will create an instance of the resulting Custom Resource Definition (CRD) which will deploy the Helm chart and configure the localization.\nBootstrapping The bootstrap process consists of creating the OCM Controller resources that will download and apply the ResourceGraphDefinition. First, we will create a Repository and Component resource that point to the OCM component in the registry (the Component resource is reused in the ResourceGraphDefinition (see above) as reference for the Resource resources). Then, we create the Resource resource that references by name to the OCM resource containing the ResourceGraphDefinition. Finally, we will create a Deployer resource that will download the ResourceGraphDefinition and apply it to the cluster.\nTo proceed, create the following file named bootstrap.yaml containing the above-mentioned resources:\napiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Repository metadata: name: bootstrap-repository spec: repositorySpec: # Adjust to your OCM repository baseUrl: ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; type: OCIRegistry interval: 1m # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it. # ocmConfig: --- apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Component metadata: name: bootstrap-component spec: component: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/bootstrap repositoryRef: name: bootstrap-repository semver: 1.0.0 interval: 1m # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it. # ocmConfig: --- apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Resource metadata: name: bootstrap-rgd namespace: default spec: componentRef: name: bootstrap-component resource: byReference: resource: name: resource-graph-definition interval: 1m # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it. # ocmConfig: --- apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Deployer metadata: name: bootstrap-deployer spec: resourceRef: # Reference to the Kubernetes resource OCM resource that contains the ResourceGraphDefinition. name: bootstrap-rgd # As kro processes resources in cluster-scope*, the deployer must also be cluster-scoped. Accordingly, we have to # set the namespace of the resource here (usually, when the namespace is not specified, it is derived from the # referencing Kubernetes resource). # Check out the kro documentation for more details: # https://github.com/kro-run/kro/blob/8f53372bfde232db7ddd6809eebb6a1d69b34f2e/website/docs/docs/concepts/20-access-control.md namespace: default # ocmConfig is required, if the OCM repository requires credentials to access it. # (You also need to specify the namespace of the reference as the \u0026#39;deployer\u0026#39; is cluster-scoped.) # ocmConfig:\rAgain, if your OCM component version is stored in a private registry, you need to provide credentials for the OCM Controller resources to access the OCM repository. You can do so by specifying the ocmConfig field in the Repository, Component, Resource, and Deployer resources. For more information on how to set up credentials, please refer to the OCM Controllers credentials guide.\nAfterwards, apply the bootstrap.yaml to the cluster:\nkubectl apply -f bootstrap.yaml\rThis will create all the defined resources in the cluster and reconcile them. This can take a few seconds. As a result, you should see the ResourceGraphDefinition being created in the cluster:\nkubectl get rgd\rNAME APIVERSION KIND STATE AGE bootstrap v1alpha1 Bootstrap Active 2m56s By applying the ResourceGraphDefinition successfully, a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) named Bootstrap is created in the cluster. Check if the CRD is available by using the following command:\nkubectl get crd bootstraps.kro.run\rNAME CREATED AT bootstraps.kro.run 2025-05-28T11:40:38Z Troubleshooting You can check the status of the ResourceGraphDefinition by investigating the status of the resources or the logs of the ocm-k8s-toolkit-controller-manager.\nOne common issue, when using GitHub\u0026rsquo;s container registry, is that the transferred OCM component is by default a private package. If so, you might see an error like the following:\nfailed to list versions: failed to list tags: GET \u0026#34;https://ghcr.io/v2...\u0026#34;: response status code 401: unauthorized: authentication required You can resolve this issue by making the package public or by providing credentials to the respective resources.\nCreating an instance After applying the ResourceGraphDefinition and making sure that the resulting CRD is available, we can create an instance of the CRD, which will deploy the Helm chart and configure the localization. To do so, create a file containing the following content and name it instance.yaml:\napiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1 kind: Bootstrap metadata: name: bootstrap\rThen, apply the instance to the cluster:\nkubectl apply -f instance.yaml\rIf successful, you should see the following output:\nkubectl get bootstrap\rNAME STATE SYNCED AGE bootstrap ACTIVE True 3m23s If the instance is in the ACTIVE state, the resources defined in the ResourceGraphDefinition were created and reconciled. This includes the OCM Controller resources for the Helm chart and the image, as well as FluxCDs resources for the OCI repository and the Helm release. Accordingly, you should see the following deployment in the cluster. To see, if the deployment was successful, you can use the following command:\nkubectl get deployments\rNAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE bootstrap-release-podinfo 1/1 1 1 4m25s Finally, you can check the pod itself to see if the localization was applied correctly by checking the image name in the container::\nkubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=bootstrap-release-podinfo -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.items[0].spec.containers[0].image}\u0026#39;\rghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.9.1 You now have successfully created an OCM component containing a Helm chart, the respective image for localization, and a ResourceGraphDefintion to deploy your Helm chart and localize the image. By creating the required bootstrap-resources you bootstrapped the ResourceGraphDefinition from the OCM component and created the resulting CRD. Finally, you created an instance of the CRD which deployed the Helm chart and configured the localization using the OCM Controllers, kro, and FluxCD.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":17,"permalink":"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/deploying-a-helm-chart-with-bootstrap/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/introduction/#concept\"\u003econcept\u003c/a\u003e and the \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/deploying-a-helm-chart/\"\u003eprevious guide\u003c/a\u003e showed a basic example of how to deploy a Helm chart from an OCM component.\nBy defining a \u003ccode\u003eResourceGraphDefinition\u003c/code\u003e that contains all the required resources to deploy the Helm chart into a\nKubernetes cluster.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[],"title":"Deploying a Helm Chart (with Bootstrap)"},{"content":"OCM Controller resources need access to OCM components and their resources. If these OCM components are stored in a private OCM repository, we need to configure credentials to allow OCM Controller resources to access these repositories.\nHow to configure credentials? Currently, OCM Controllers supports two ways to configure credentials for accessing private OCM repositories:\nKubernetes secret of type dockerconfigjson Kubernetes secret or configmap containing an .ocmconfig file Create a Kubernetes secret of type dockerconfigjson If you already have an existing Docker configuration file that you use to access your private OCM repository, you can create a Kubernetes secret of type dockerconfigjson that contains the credentials:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry ocm-secret --from-file=\u0026lt;path-to-your-docker-config-file\u0026gt;\rBe aware that Kubernetes secrets are only base64 encoded and not encrypted. This means that anyone with access to the Kubernetes secret can access the credentials.\nAccordingly, you should make sure that the Docker configuration file only contains information required for accessing the private OCM repository.\nIn case you want to create the secret manually, you can use the following command to create a Kubernetes secret of type dockerconfigjson:\nkubectl create secret docker-registry ocm-secret \\ --docker-username=\u0026lt;your-name\u0026gt; \\ --docker-password=\u0026lt;your-password\u0026gt; \\ --docker-server=\u0026lt;your-OCM-repository-url\u0026gt;\rCreate a Kubernetes secret or configmap from .ocmconfig file To create a Kubernetes secret or configmap containing an OCM configuration that allows OCM Controller resources to access private OCM repositories, you can use the .ocmconfig file used to transfer the OCM component in the first place.\nUsually, the .ocmconfig file is located in your HOME directory. However, this .ocmconfig could contain more configurations than just the credentials for accessing private OCM repositories. As this .ocmconfig will be used to create a Kubernetes secret or configmap to which other users might have access to, you have to make sure that it only contains the configuration you want to share.\nWe recommend to create a new .ocmconfig file that only contains the credentials for accessing the private OCM repository.\nFor more information on how to create and use the .ocmconfig file, please refer to the [OCM CLI credentials documentation][ocm-credentials].\nFor instance, consider you used the following command and .ocmconfig file to transfer the OCM component:\ntype: generic.config.ocm.software/v1 configurations: - type: credentials.config.ocm.software consumers: - identity: type: OCIRegistry scheme: https hostname: ghcr.io pathprefix: \u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; credentials: - type: Credentials properties: username: \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt; password: \u0026lt;your-password/token\u0026gt;\rocm --config ./.ocmconfig transfer ctf ./ctf ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt;\rYou can now create a secret in the Kubernetes cluster that contains the .ocmconfig file:\nkubectl create secret generic ocm-secret --from-file=./.ocmconfig\rMake sure that the secret or configmap containing an OCM config has the correct key to the OCM config file .ocmconfig. This is required for OCM Controller resources to be able to read the OCM configuration. Using the filename .ocmconfig in the --from-file option takes care of that.\nHow to use the configured credentials? Every OCM Controller resource offers a spec.ocmConfig field that can be used to specify the credentials for accessing private OCM repositories. It expects an OCMConfiguration that contains a NamespacedObjectKindReference to the secret or configmap that contains the credentials.\napiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Repository metadata: name: helm-configuration-localization-repository spec: repositorySpec: baseUrl: ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; type: OCIRegistry interval: 1m ocmConfig: - kind: secret name: ocm-secret\rBy default, the ocmConfig of a resource is propagated and can be consumed by other resources. So, instead of specifying the secret or configmap again, you can reference the resource in the ocmConfig field:\napiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Repository metadata: name: guide-repository namespace: default spec: repositorySpec: baseUrl: ghcr.io/\u0026lt;your-namespace\u0026gt; type: OCIRegistry interval: 1m ocmConfig: - kind: Secret name: ocm-secret --- apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Component metadata: name: guide-component spec: component: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/guide-component repositoryRef: name: guide-repository semver: 1.0.0 interval: 1m ocmConfig: - kind: Repository apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 name: guide-repository namespace: default\rThe above example shows how to use the ocmConfig field in an Repository and a Component. The Repository references a secret named ocm-secret that contains the credentials for accessing the private OCM repository. The Component then references the Repository in ocmConfigand uses the same credentials.\nHowever, you always need to specify a reference to the credentials either as secret, configmap, or as OCM Controller resource for each resource. The credentials will not be propagated automatically to all OCM Controller resources in the cluster.\nIn some cases, you do not want to propagate the ocmConfig of a resource. To do so, you can set the policy to DoNotPropagate:\napiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 kind: Component metadata: name: guide-component spec: component: ocm.software/ocm-k8s-toolkit/guide-component repositoryRef: name: guide-repository semver: 1.0.0 interval: 1m ocmConfig: - kind: Repository apiVersion: delivery.ocm.software/v1alpha1 name: guide-repository namespace: default policy: DoNotPropagate\r","date":"0001-01-01","id":18,"permalink":"/dev/docs/getting-started/ocm-controllers/configuring-credentials/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOCM Controller resources need access to OCM components and their resources.

A component version consists of a set of technical artifacts (e.g., Docker images, Helm charts, binaries, configuration data, etc.). Such artifacts are called resources in this specification. Resources are usually built from something, e.g., code in a git repo. Those are named sources in this specification.\nOCM introduces a Component Version for every component version that describes the resources, sources, and other component versions belonging to a particular component version and how to access them.\nUsually, however, real-life applications are composed of multiple components. For example, an application might consist of a frontend, a backend, a database, and a web server. During the software development process new component versions are created and third-party components might be consumed from a public registry and updated from time to time.\nNot all component version combinations of frontend, backend, database, etc. are compatible and form a valid product version. In order to define reasonable version combinations for the software product, we could use another feature of OCM\u0026rsquo;s Component Version, called a Component Reference (or reference in short), which allows the aggregation of component versions.\nFor each sub-component and each version in use, there is a Component Version. For the entire application, we introduce a new component that describes the overall software product referencing all components. This describes the entire application or product.\nA particular version of this application is again described by a Component Version, which contains references to the Component Versions of its sub-components in their version in use. You are not restricted to this approach. It is, e.g., possible to create multi-level hierarchies or you could just maintain a list of component version combinations which build a valid product release.\nIn a nutshell, OCM provides a simple approach to specify what belongs to a product version. Starting with the Component Version for a product version and following the component references, you could collect all artifacts belonging to this product version.\nPrerequisites We assume that you have already read the guides in the Getting Started section, as this guide discusses a more complex scenario.\nConstructing the Component We are going to use podinfo in microservices mode. This describes a setup with multiple microservices forming a larger application.\npodinfo has three services which we are going to model using individual component versions:\nbackend frontend cache (redis) We will use the following example application to demonstrate a multi-component structure using podinfo: Podinfo Component.\nThis repository contains the following items:\nComponent File The following component-constructor file describes four components: three components, each representing a podinfo microservice and one aggregated component that brings together the podinfo components using references. We refer to the aggregated component as the product component. A component-constructor file can contain one or multiple components and references to other components. The file is a YAML file and can be validated using the OCM schema.\n# specify a schema to validate the configuration and get auto-completion in your editor # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://ocm.software/schemas/configuration-schema.yaml components: # -- product component -

There are two different ways to add content: Input Type and Access Type.\nFor the real comprehensive official documentation, please have a look on GitHub (or ocm-cli help).\nAn Input type adds content by value, along with the component descriptor and stores it in the same target repository where the component is stored. After pushing the content to the target registry this always resolves to the attribute\nrelation: local\rin a component descriptor.\nAn Access Type just adds content by reference to an external location, e.g., an OCI registry. It is a kind of pointer in a component descriptor. It resolves to the attribute\nrelation: external\rin a component descriptor.\nThe following input types are supported:\nbinary dir docker dockermulti file helm ociImage spiff utf-8 Please use the latest ocm-cli to check available input types:\nocm add resources --help | grep \u0026#39; - Input type\u0026#39; | sort -f\rThe following list of access types is supported:\ngitHub localBlob ociArtifact ociBlob s3 Please use the latest ocm-cli to check available access types:\nocm ocm-accessmethods | grep \u0026#39; - Access type\u0026#39; | sort -f\rNot all access and input types can be combined in useful ways with all artifact types. But the OCM specification does not define any restrictions on possible combinations.\nThe following sections give an overview and typical usage examples for access and input types. It does not describe the full list of possible fields and their meaning. For a complete list of attributes, please see the command reference. The examples below are meant to be used in a component that looks like this:\n- name: github.com/open-component-model/megacomponent version: 0.1.0\rInput Types binary Allows to define resources with binary content being base64 encoded.

By default, the CLI looks for configuration in $HOME/.ocmconfig, if it exists.\nThe configuration file can be used in particular to specify the credentials, which are required for the CLI to be able to access the artifact repositories referenced in CLI commands.\nExamples This page contains basic examples of credentials configuration for a few most common artifact repository types. The examples below are complete .ocmconfig files, not snippets.\nFor comprehensive documentation on the credentials topic, including usage of certificates or HashiCorp Vault, execute the command ocm credential-handling.\nRepositories and Consumers In the examples below, some configuration is located under configurations[0].repositories, and some other under configurations[0].consumers. This chapter explains the difference between repositories and consumers, which is potentially not as obvious as one could think.\nIn this context, repository is a place where credentials can be stored, i.e., it is a credentials repository. For example, Docker\u0026rsquo;s config.json can store multiple credentials, and in that sense the file serves as a repository that can store and provide credentials. That is why its location is configured under repositories. Other examples of credentials repositories can be the NPM\u0026rsquo;s .npmrc file or a HashiCorp Vault instance.\nA consumer is something the credentials are required for. For example, if you need to configure credentials that are required to log in to an OCI registry, one could say that the registry will be consuming these credentials, i.e., the registry is a credentials consumer. That is why it is configured under consumers.\nReuse Credentials Configured for Docker This .ocmconfig file will tell the OCM CLI to use credentials configuration from Docker\u0026rsquo;s config.json file.\ntype: generic.config.ocm.software/v1 configurations: - type: credentials.config.ocm.software repositories: - repository: type: DockerConfig/v1 dockerConfigFile: \u0026#34;~/.docker/config.json\u0026#34;\rReuse Credentials Configured for npm This .ocmconfig file will tell OCM CLI to use credentials configuration from npm\u0026rsquo;s .npmrc file.\ntype: generic.config.ocm.software/v1 configurations: - type: credentials.config.ocm.software repositories: - repository: type: NPMConfig/v1 npmrcFile: \u0026#39;~/.npmrc\u0026#39;\rAccessing OCI Registries HTTPS and Path To access artifacts in https://ghcr.io/open-component-model:\nThe different parts of the URL have to be specified in separate fields: scheme, hostname, and pathprefix The fields scheme and pathprefix are optional.

When the format is set to \u0026ldquo;gobuildinfo\u0026rdquo;, it outputs the Go build information as a string. The format is standardized and unified across all golang applications.\nWhen the format is set to \u0026ldquo;gobuildinfojson\u0026rdquo;, it outputs the Go build information in JSON format. This is equivalent to \u0026ldquo;gobuildinfo\u0026rdquo;, but in a structured JSON format.\nThe build info by default is drawn from the go module build information, which is set at build time of the CLI.

Here are some of the channels we use to communicate and contribute:\nGitHub Our GitHub repositories are the central hub for all project development. Connect with our codebase, report issues, submit pull requests, and follow our project\u0026rsquo;s progress. New contributors can find issues labeled good first issue to get started, and our detailed contribution guidelines will help you make your first successful submission.\nSlack Join our #open-component-model channel in the Kubernetes Slack workspace and connect with us and other community members.\nKubernetes Slack Membership\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t already a member in the Kubernetes Slack workspace, please request an invitation\nOur team is passionate about delving into diverse deployment processes, exploring patterns, aiding in design, and troubleshooting issues. Who knows? Your inquiry might inspire the development of the next useful OCM feature!\nCommunity Calls We\u0026rsquo;re excited to announce our regular community calls:\nSchedule Frequency: Every first Wednesday of the months Time: 16:00-17:00 UTC (17:00-18:00 CET, 11:00-12:00 EST, 08:00-09:00 PST) Duration: 1 hour Location: Use this Zoom Link to join the call. Call History This page contains the history of the Open Component Model community calls and links to slides and recordings.\nWhat to Expect Join us to see and discuss project updates, share your feedback, ask questions, and connect with other community members. The community calls should be an open discussion space and give a voice to any interested stakeholder. At the same time we want our community to be diverse, helpful, collaborative and fun.\nThese calls are open to everyone and will be moderated by at least one OCM Core Maintainer. We will answer anything you might bring up!\nWhat to Bring We want to hear from you! This is your chance to share your thoughts and ideas with the community. You can bring anything, including:\nIdeas how to make OCM better Issues you would like to talk about and that should be addressed Concepts you would like to work on together Questions you have about the community or upcoming work Contributing We welcome community contributions! Please see the Contributing Guideline for instructions on how to submit changes. If you are planning on making more elaborate or potentially controversial changes, please discuss them with the maintainers in the Slack channel before sending a pull request.\nCode of Conduct To make OCM a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, we follow the CNCF Code of Conduct.\nSpecial Interest Groups (SIGs) OCM grows when people build together — and our Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are where ideas turn into impact.\nSIGs are focused working groups that take ownership of a specific area of the project and move it forward.\nFollowing the example of other CNCF projects, we defined a framework for SIGs to help contributors collaborate effectively.\nThe SIG Handbook covers:\ngoals and motivation behind SIGs roles and responsibilities how to propose, establish, and run a SIG Status: We’re in the kick-off phase — there are no active SIGs yet. That’s your chance to shape the very first ones! As SIGs form, we’ll list them here.\nHow to get involved Curious? Start with the SIG Handbook. Have a topic in mind? Follow the handbook’s steps to propose a SIG and gather interested contributors. Prefer to join later? Keep an eye on this page — we’ll announce and list new SIGs here. Security Guideline In case you want to report any security vulnerabilities inside the Open Component Model project, please do not report them through public GitHub issues.\nPlease visit the Open Source Security Policy for more information.\n","date":"0001-01-01","id":58,"permalink":"/dev/community/engagement/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-engage-with-us\"\u003eHow to engage with us\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Open Component Model is developed in the open.
